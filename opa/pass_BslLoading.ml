  The plugins are accumulated during the compilation, as well as the extralib and extrapaths
  needed for using them.

  A warning is nevertheless produced by the bypass typer when a bypass is normaly not in
  the scope of the current package.
  This appears only in autobuild mode, e.g. compiling a package B after a package A,
  when :
  -the package A imports the plugin P
  -the package B does not imports the plugin P
  -B uses bypass from P

  This situation works because of the side effects accumulated there,
  but the user is just warned that if he would try to compile the package B separatly,
  it would not work, and invite him to add the import-plugin P in the package B.
