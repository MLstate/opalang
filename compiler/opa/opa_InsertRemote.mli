(** Resolve slicer directives by stubs and skeletons.

    {6 Resolving directive}
    This module provides 2 main functions, for transform server and
    client code.  Both functions have the same behavior for resolve
    directives. We have 3 types of directives where functions works :

    - [publish_directive] : Resolved by skeleton generation and by
    registration of this in a rpc dispatcher.

    - [call_directive] : Resolved by stub generation and by
    replacement of the call_directive by the ident of generated
    stub. Of course stubs are shared. For example if in code we have
    several @*_call(toto) we generate only one toto_stub.

    - [insert_directive] : This directive have a sense only on client
    side. It's resolved by generation of a new directive for the
    client code compiler. This directive is [\@hybrid_value] and it
    contains two expressions. First of them is a client expression,
    this expression is type [string -> 'a]. Second is a expression that
    must be computed on server, and this expression is a [string].


    {9 Skeleton generation}

    Skeleton maybe generated for functional value, or non-functional
    value. Generated skeletons get only one arguments, it's a
    [string]. This arguments represents the serialized request. This
    request should be contains all arguments of the functions (or any
    if it's a skeleton for value). And should contains for all type
    variable (in type of this function) an type argument (or any if
    it's a skeleton for value). After several verification on request,
    it call a non optimized (for explicit instantiation) function.
    Finally it serialize the result.

    A generic example (in Opa Style) :
    {[
      fun str ->
        match OpaRPC.unserialize str with
        | {some = request} ->
          (match OpaRPC.extract_type request with
           | [i1; i2; ...] ->
             (match OpaTsc.implementation [i1; i2; ...] tsc with
              | { TyArrow_params = [t1; t2; t3; ...]; TyArrow_res = tres } ->
                (match  OpaRPC.extract_value [t1; t2; t3; ...] request  with
                | { some = [a1; a2; a3; ...] } ->
                  { some = OpaValue.serialize tres
                        (sliced_fun i1 i2 ... a1 a2 a3 ...) }
                | _ -> { none = () })
              | _ -> { none = () })
           | _ -> { none = () })
        | _ -> { none = () }
      : string -> string option
    ]}

    An concret example : skeleton for toto of type [list('a) -> int ->
    option('a)]
    {[
    val tsc = {
      quantifier = [{TyVar = "'a"}];
      body = {TyArrow_params = [list('a); int];
              TyArrow_res = option('a)}
    }
    fun str ->
      match OpaRPC.unserialize str with
      | {some = request} ->
        (match OpaRPC.extract_type request with
         | [i1] ->
           (match OpaTYpe.instantiate [i1] tsc with
            | { TyArrow_params = [t1; t2]; TyArrow_res = tres } ->
              (match  OpaRPC.extract_value [t1; t2] request with
               | { some = [a1; a2] } ->
                 { some = OpaValue.serialize tres (toto_exp i1 a1 a2) }
               | _ -> { none = () })
             | _ -> { none = () })
         | _ -> { none = () })
      | _ -> { none = () }
    : string -> string option
    ]}

    For conclusion, generated skeleton make :
    - Unserialize RPC request represented by argument of the
    skeleton.
    - Extract instantiate types include in request (if original type
    scheme have type variable).
    - Extract value and check with instantiate type of function.
    - Call to the function with type arguments and values.
    - Serialize the response.

    {9 Stub generation}
    Generated stub is just a function that make a correct request for
    the correspondig skeleton, and execute a distant call to the other
    side. For finish it check response.

    A generic example (in Opa Style) :
    {[
    fun i1 -> fun i2 -> ... ->
      fun a1 -> fun a2 -> fun a3 ->
        match OpaTsc.implementation [i1; i2; ...] tsc /*type scheme of the function*/ with
        | { TyArrow_params = [t1; t2; t3; ...]; TyArrow_res = tres } } ->
          match
            send_to_<side>
              "<function_id>"
              (OpaRPC.serialize
                (OpaRPC.add_args t3 a3
                (OpaRPC.add_args t2 a2
                (OpaRPC.add_args t1 a1
                  (OpaRPC.add_var_types i2
                  (OpaRPC.add_var_types i1 OpaRPC.empty_request))))))
            tres
          with
          | { some = res } -> res
          | _ -> /* Make an error */
        | _ -> /* Make an error */
    ]}

    A concret example : stub for toto of type [list('a) -> int ->
    option('a)]
    {[
    val tsc = {
        quantifier = [{TyVar = "'a"}];
        body = {TyArrow_params = [list('a); int];
                TyArrow_res = option('a)}
      }
    fun t1 -> fun a1 -> fun a2 ->
      match OpaTsc.implementation [i1] tsc with
      | { TyArrow_params = [t1; t2]; TyArrow_res = tres } } ->
        match
          send_to_<side>
            "<function_id>"
            (OpaRPC.serialize
              (OpaRPC.add_args t2 a2
              (OpaRPC.add_args t1 a1
                (OpaRPC.add_var_types i1 OpaRPC.empty_request))))
          tres
        with
        | { some = res } -> res
        | _ -> /* Make an error */
      | _ -> /* Make an error */
    ]}

    For conclusion, generated skeleton make :
    - Instantiate type scheme
    - Match the instantiated type scheme
    - Add instantiate type variable of the function to an empty
     request. (Type given at runtime, like exp-inst).
    - Add argument (with here type) to request
    - Send serialized request, and check returned value with tres.

    {9 Pre-conditions}

    {9 Post-conditions}

    - All generated stubs, skeletons (and registration of skeletons) are
    added on the code, but it's not guaranteed that the code is well
    ordered.

    - Code is already typed.

    - Doesn't break lambda lifting.
