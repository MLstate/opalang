   Compilation to Javascript, and reinsertion of the code in the qml.
   @author Mathieu Barbin
   @author Maxime Audoin
*)

(**

   The client code is compiled to [JsAst], and then serialized, using the runtime JsAst
   defined in the package [stdlib.js].
   The serialized js supports a runtime alpha-renaming and dead code elimination.
   This code is reinjected in the server code.

   Compositionality:
   + We should remember the list of extra libs and plugin already compiled and registred
   to avoid to register them several time.
*)

(**
   Process the code.

   FIXME:

   + passing options arround will probably become deprecated when we will be finished
   with the refactoring of private options with local Arg modules directly in passes.

   + the typing environment is probably needed as read-only.
   The reinjected code can be not typed, nobody cares.

   The returned value is the server with the client reinjected.
