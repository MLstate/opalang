(**
   Loading the standard library.
*)

(**
   The stdlib can be loaded in two ways.

   1) [of_static_include]
   This is the default one, it works as follows:

   - A [staticsInclude.of] file is generated by the build system (see
   ../build_rules.ml), automatically selecting files to be included from the
   stdlib directory
   - ofile is used to turn the [staticsInclude.of] into [staticsInclude.ml],
   embedding all stdlib source as strings (this is done by the generic ofile
   build rule)
   - the [StaticsInclude] module is included in [opalib.cmxa] and used at
   compile-time
   - the mechanism in the current module enables to switch between different
   (conflicting) versions for some stdlib files

   2) [of_basedir]
   The second version dynamically looks for the files at opa compile-time (ie ml runtime).
   Only use for more easily testing your changes to the stdlib. It uses the [of_basedir]
   function below.
*)

type filename = string

(**
   Returns all the filenames of the stdlib embedded in the compiler.
   cf [build_rules.ml], we access the [StaticsInclude.file_list],
   and applying the dynamic filter.
*)
val of_static_include : OpaEnv.opa_options -> filename list

(**
   Get all the opafiles from the basedir, and applying the same dynamic filter.
*)
val of_basedir : filename list -> OpaEnv.opa_options -> filename list
