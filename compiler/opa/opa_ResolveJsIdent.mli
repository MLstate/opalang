(**
   Replace all directive like [\@js_ident("val")] by a reference to
   a hoisted identifier which is a valid js identifier ["compiled_ident_of_val_in_js"]

   The pass add also the toplevel declaration calling the [JsIdent_rename] function.

   Example:
   Input code
   {[
   t(x) = "{@js_ident("toto")}(x, y)"
   ]}

   Output code
   {[
   _v0_toto = %%bslJsIdent_rename%%("toto")
   ...
   t(x) = "{_v0_toto}(x, y)"
   ]}
