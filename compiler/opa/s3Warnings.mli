   Regrouping all warnings for opa S3.

   <!> Read carrefully the documentation.
   This module is not meant to define any wclass.
   It is simply a regroupement of all warnings we want
   to be available in the binary opa.exe version S3

   We could have define it directly in main.ml,
   but this would have lead to have too much commit on the
   main. (we may want to combine lots of warning_set in this file)

val warning_set : WarningClass.Set.t
