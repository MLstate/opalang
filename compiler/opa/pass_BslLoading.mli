   Loading bsl plugins (bypass)
   @author Mathieu Barbin

(**
   Load the BSL and any plug-in.

   Plug-ins are .cma/.cmo/.cmxs files, as documented in the documentation of libbsl.
   Plug-ins are first registered and then properly loaded.

   Registration takes place in the following order:
   - Opa standard bypass library (defined in module {!OpabslPlugin})
   - files specified through command-line arguments {v *.opp v}, searched in the current
     directory and directories specified through command-line option {v -I v} -- if several files
     match the name specified, a warning is displayed and the first such file is used.
   - plugin specified through source files, using the import-plugin syntax

   Plugins are then sorted topologically by dependency.

   Finally, plug-ins are loaded both by the common BSL and a backend-specific loader and
   a dummy-backend bypass map is produced. This map contains all the bypasses -- if you
   need to restrict to a subset, use {restrict_any} or {restrict_all}.

   Loading is ensured by {!Dynlink} or {!Marshal}.
   This pass fails and exits if a module cannot be loaded or
   in case of circular dependencies.

   This pass returns an bsl environment, which is a bymap (indexed bypasses)
   and a list of plugins, sorted in a topologic order wrt their dependency order.
