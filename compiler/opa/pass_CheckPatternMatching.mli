   Checking on Pattern Matching.

(**
   This pass perform some checks on pattern matching.
   In case of illicit patterns, the pass simply raise some warnings
   with located error messages.

   The code is typed, so that we can perform more clever checks.

   Currently, the code is not transformed.
   We can activate a toggle for applying the pattern normalization,
   until we decide in what cases we do want to keep the normalized
   version (if e.g. size explosion)
