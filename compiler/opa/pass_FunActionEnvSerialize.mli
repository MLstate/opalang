(**
   Fun action resolution : Insertion of environment serialization.

(**
   This module implements part of the funactions resolution for opa.
   This is the step 2), taking place :
   + after Typing and Slicing
   + before Explicit instantation.


   This pass insert in the code generating the xhml sent to clients containing fun actions
   the serialization of the environment of the fun action, corresponding to the argument
   already applied.

   Initial expressions
   {[
   < onclick=\{EXPR = \@funaction(e)\}>
   ]}

   After [FunActionLifting]
   {[
   f(arg1,arg2,...)=e
   < onclick=\{EXPR = \@funaction( f(arg1,arg2,...) ) \}>
   ]}

   Then, [typing, slicing].

   After [FunActionEnvSerialize]
   {[
   f(arg1,arg2,...)=e
   < onclick=\{EXPR = \@funaction(
                  arg1_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg1)
                  arg2_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg2)
                  ...
                  (\@funaction[client_id](f))(
                        \@funaction[Deserialize](arg1_),
                        \@funaction[Deserialize](arg2_),
                        ...
                  )
                  )
                  \} >
   ]}

   The pass is after typing, and should preserve types.

   Types of directive:
   + {[\@funaction('a) : 'a]}
   + {[\@funaction[Deserialized]({arg : 'a ; serialized_arg : string}) : 'a]}
   + {[\@funaction[cliend_id]('a) : 'a]}

   So, essentially, the kernel of this pass is the following, applied only
   on the server side code :

   From all directives :
   {[
   \@funaction( f(arg1,arg2,...) )
   ]}

   To
   {[
   \@funaction(
     arg1_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg1)
     arg2_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg2)
     ...
     (\@funaction[client_id](f))(
     \@funaction[Deserialize](arg1_),
     \@funaction[Deserialize](arg2_),
   ...
     )
   )
   ]}
