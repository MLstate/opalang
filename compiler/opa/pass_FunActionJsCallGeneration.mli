(**
   Fun action resolution : Generation of js call in the xhtml

(**
   This module implements part of the funactions resolution for opa.
   This is the step 3), taking place :
   + after Explicit instantation.
   + before CPS and Global Lambda lifting

   This pass replace the fields [on*events] (onclick, onready, etc....) by the Js Code corresponding to the execution
   of the fun action, which is executed totally on the client side, without any request to the server.
   This pass uses also an optimization (like the hybrid values at toplevel) : whenever it is possible, the Js Code
   generated can be either a call to [unserialize], or directly a back-end dependant Js Code.


   Before the pass, after [FunActionEnvSerialize], the code is :
   {[
   f(arg1,arg2,...)=e
   < onclick=\{EXPR = \@funaction(
                  arg1_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg1)
                  arg2_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg2)
                  ...
                  (\@funaction[client_id](f))(
                        \@funaction[Deserialize](arg1_),
                        \@funaction[Deserialize](arg2_),
                        ...
                  )
                  )
                  \} >
   ]}

   After this pass :
   {[
   f(arg1,arg2,...)=e
   < onclick=\{STRING =
                  arg1_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg1)
                  arg2_ = FunActionServer_serialize_argument(arg2)
                  ...
                  FunActionServer_serialize_call(
                        \@jsident(f),
                        [ arg_1_,
                          arg_2_,
                          ...
                        ]
                  )
                  \}
    >
   ]}

   The pass is after typing, and should preserve types.
