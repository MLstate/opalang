(** Handle [QmlAst.opavalue_directive] and extend corresponding magic
    function with the specialized function, by toplevel registering.

    For example : [\@stringifier f(x) = ...]
    is transformed to : {[
    f(x) = ...
    _ = OpaValue_add_to_string(f)
    ]}

    BEWARE : Enrich magic can works only if closures are activated.

*)

(** Process the qml code and returns a [map] that bind a generic
    funtion to specialized functions (see [Pass_SimplifyMagic]),
    updated [annotmap] and [code]. *)
val process_code :
  stdlib:QmlTypes.gamma ->
  gamma:QmlTypes.gamma ->
  annotmap:QmlAst.annotmap ->
  QmlAst.code ->
  Pass_SimplifyMagic.env * QmlAst.annotmap * QmlAst.code

(** Just purge [QmlAst.opavalue_directive]. Usefull if closures are
    unactivated.*)
