   Typing Directives (language and compilation).
*)

(**
   This module can regroup utils working on directives.
   It is meant to be not far after QmlAst wrt the dependencies between modules.
   Possibly, the printer of string_of_directives can also be moved in that file.
*)

(**
   The type of the variant used for directives.
   Ideally in S4, the same variant groups should be shared between Opa and QML
*)
type directive = QmlAst.qml_directive


(** {6 Type of Directive} *)

(**
   A directive is used for extensible utilisation of the AST.
   It can have a som expressions in arguments, and some types as well.
   Currently, it is not possible in the syntax to write types arguments for a directives,
   but it is a TODO.
   See some examples :
   {[
   \@take_expr_and_ty("titi", "toto" ; float, (int -> int), (int, char -> bool))
   \@take_just_ty(; char)
   \@take_just_expr("titi")
   ]}

   The type of directive is known statically, and defined in this module.
   The typer, as well as [QmlAstCons.TypedExpr] use this module to type directive.
*)
val ty : directive -> QmlAst.expr list -> QmlAst.ty list -> QmlAst.ty

(** {6 Utils} *)

(**
   Get the arguments of the directive `create_lazy_record directives.
   The info is optional, the arguments are on the form :
   {[
   | [expr]
   | [expr ; info]
   ]}
   The returned tuple is the expr, and the optional info
