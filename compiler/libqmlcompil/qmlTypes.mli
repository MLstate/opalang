    ABOUT GENERALIZATION and the dependancies between TypeScheme and TypeEnv
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The generalization should normaly depends on gamma since the processus of
    generalization need to access all the free-vars of gamma.

    The academic type for function generalize is :

    [val generalize : gamma -> ty -> typescheme]

    But we don't want to have a mutuall dependancy between modules rec TypeScheme and
    TypeEnv !!
    (it was to difficult to get away of module rec, so let's try not to do it again)

    We need just a common representation define here for the "QmlTypeVars.quantif", and then
    provide a function in gamma :

    [val freevars : gamma -> QmlTypeVars.quantif]

    then TypeEnv can depend on TypeScheme.

    We do not want that this type to be public, but it must be shared between
    TypeScheme and TypeEnv

    That's why we define these 2 modules in the same file : QmlTypes.ml

    in the ml, the module are not coerced, implementation is shared.
    with this mli, we abstract the implementation of it for the rest of the world

    The implementation can only raise Exceptions defined in QmlTyperException

(** {b Descr}: Represents the number of chained type abbreviations this
    constructor leads to. For instance:
    - [int] : being a basic type, its height is 0.
    - [type t1 = int] : t1's height is 1 + int's height = 1.
    - [type t2 = t1] : 1 + t2's height = 2.

    Can also be negative. In this case, it represents the position (numbered
    from 1) of the definition's variable that will give (once the constructor
    of the definition will be used) the height of the resulting type expression.
    For instance:
     - [type u('a, 'b) = 'b] : The height of a type expression using [u] is
       the height of the effective argument provided to instantiate ['b]. Hence,
       u's height is -2 (minus of the second argument).
       Then, using [t2] above in the espression [u(t2, int)] will give a height
       of 0 ([int] has height 0) and [u(int, t2)] will give a height of 2
       ([t2] has height 2).
    {b Visibility}: Transparently visible outside this module. We do not hid
    its implementation since manipulations of heights are very frequent and
    we prefer to avoid some overhead induced by wrapping functions.
    In effect, such information is used by [QmlMakeTyper] on the QML side and
    its better to have it seeing the implementation. This information is also
    used by the low-level typer W.                                            *)

      ABOUT GENERALIZATION :
      -----------------------

      With the value of first level, it should not be any non-closed schema,
      so gamma is not needed to generalize the type of such values --

      so it is possible to define :

      val quantify : ty -> t   ( returning a closed schema )

      a [generalization_with_gamma] is called only internly by the typer in a
      w algorithm at least so it should theoreticly not be put in the API,
      but then, since Scheme.t is private, the typer wont be able to provide
      the implementation for it

      +    However, if somebody writte a typer, he should know that the generalization
      needs the freevars of gamma and then he will use the function generalize, not the quantify
      function

      +    If a human user (not a typer guy) mistakes, and call the function generalize instead of
      quantify on a first level type of qml, it is equivalent (can just be less efficient)

      Both contain a refresh on quantified variables, to be sure that any vars of
      ty cannot appear in typescheme if ty will be corrupted later,
      typescheme keep clean *)

  val generalize : gamma -> QmlAst.ty -> t
  val quantify : QmlAst.ty -> t

 (**
     EXTRA API FOR TYPE DEFINITION AND NAME TYPES :
     ---------------------------------------------

     given a type, with some parameters (type definition -- [type ('a, 'b) = { a : 'a ; b : 'b } ]
     will build a schema, by verifying the well-formed property freevars(t) = params
     It will also check that the parameters are uniq :
     don't allow type ('a, 'a) toto = ....
     it possibly raises an TyperException (like arity problems, unbound typevars, etc ...)

     12/08/09, Adam: I add a restriction for recursive types, in the body of type t:
         [type ('a1, ... 'an) t]
       if there is a recursive reference to [t] it must be with _exactly the same_ parameters
       ('a1, ... 'an). If this is not the case QmlTyperException.WrongUseOfParameters is
       thrown
 *)
  val definition : ?typevar:QmlAst.typevar list -> ?ty_row:QmlAst.rowvar list -> QmlAst.typeident -> QmlAst.ty -> t
  (** if you find a TypeName ( [ int ; float], "toto") and you want to unify it with a other type,
      you will need to specialize the schema of your type scheme
      it possibly raises an TyperException (like arity problems, unbound typevars, etc ...)
      to help the error message, you must provide a TypeIdent.t (without it, the message is totally useless)

      if you don't provide any vars (all default arg are []), then the function is equivalent
      to the function [instantiate] if the schema has an empty quantification
      but will raise an exception otherwise

         ....
      in] <-- from here the abstract type toto IS NO MORE in gamma

      It brings also confusion to be able to add abstract type in gamma, for example in
      a type definition

      [type ('a, 'b) toto = abstract]

      what should we do ? people would probably say, if we let an API in gamma to
      add abstracttype, that they should probably add toto in the abstract types
      map of gamma ! but it is not implemented in this way in our code !

      we must :

      1) create a new abstract type (extern)
      2) add in gamma in the type ident map the binding "toto" -> typescheme :
              [Forall {'a, 'b} : TypeAbstract ('a, 'b) ,  toto]

      with :
      [type ('a, 'b) toto = abstract]
      you don't know the implementation of the type toto

      with :
      [let type ('a, 'b) toto = { a : 'a ; b : 'b } in ..]
      you know the implementation, so you can both bind and a new type ident with it

   HACKS IN GAMMA :
   ---------------

   we do not want that the typer use gamma like a set of hacks

   If something typer specific is missing in gamma, as long as it is not needed to
   be with dealed with a continuation, it is possible to have something like :

   (the typer inference should use a tuned gamma)

   [let w gamma expr =
     let env = { gamma = gamma ; private_extra_env = private_extra_env_empty } in
     let rec aux env e =
      ...  ... use env.gamma and env.private_extra_env
     in
     let typ = aux env e in
     typ]

   if something need continuation passing, let's talk about it, and maybe if it is
   really typer-generic and needed then it can be added in gamma
   (for example,  let's thing about add_intypingident & is_intypingident which are not necessarly in gamma !)
