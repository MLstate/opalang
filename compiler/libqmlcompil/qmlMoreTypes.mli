    The following comments is deprecated.
    This module should rather not exists.

(** The content of this file belongs *logically* to qmlTypes. It
    contains all the features that *should* be implemented there
    (directly on public types) but are not, and rather are implemented
    through HMX import. Of course this forbids them to be in qmlTypes
    because that would be a cyclic dependency. In the end, this file
    can be seen as a hack to work around the faulty Ocaml module
    system.
