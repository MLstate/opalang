(** Used when ident is renamed for bind the newest ident and the

(** {6 Defined types}*)
(** Type of renaming map *)
type t

(** {6 Construct map}*)
(** Empty renaming map. *)
val empty : t

(** [add t original_id new_id] Add a new binding. Consider
    [original_id] has renamed on [new_id].

    BEWARE : If a previous binding exists it doesn't erase, implies map is not
    bijective.
*)

(** [remove t original_id] Remove a binding with the [original_id]. *)

(** the input map must be injective *)

(** [filter t f] Construct a new map from [t] where [f original_id

(** Get the original ident from a given.
    @throw [Not_found] if given ident has not added before.*)

(** Get the new ident from a original ident.
    @throw [Not_found] if given ident has not added before.*)
