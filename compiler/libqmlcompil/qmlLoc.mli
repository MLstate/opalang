   The type of informations shared between all nodes of all ASTs.

   TODO: there is here an indirection in the record,
   QmlAst and OpaAst disagree about how to represent position,
   and annotation index in the AST.
   Some benches done by Valentin have shown that inderection for
   positions and annotation index in the AST have a terrible impact
   on performance.

   TODO: In QmlAst, maybe flatten the positions and notes in each
   constructor, like in OpaAst.

   A convenience structure to uniformly label the nodes of an AST

   Convenient maybe, but inneficient. (cf TODO)
