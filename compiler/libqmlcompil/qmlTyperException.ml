(**
   This file contains all the possible cases of Exception possibly returned by
   any Typer.
   If you want to add an exception, do it here, and provide the to_string which
   goes together.
   Remember that this file is the interface between the typer - guys and the
   user.

   This module has no mli because it would duplicate the definition of the
   type t.
