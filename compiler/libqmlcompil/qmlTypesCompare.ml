(**
   Strongly mapped on hmx_Compare.ml of the old HMX typechecker.
   This module implements comparison on QML types with the semantics that
   old HMX typechecker had when it first transformed QML types into HMX types
   then compared the HMX types.
   The idea is to remove the bridge between QML and HMX primitives since HMX
   is not used anymore. However, QML still used some parts of HMX functions
   for various things. That's the reason why this module exists.
