   Some utils related to Pass Tracking for Qml.
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   This module defines some utils for branching compilers working on QmlAst with
   the pass tracking system developed in passlib, in [PassHandler] and [PassTracker]

   In particular, it defines, given a [QmlAst.code] extractor some :
   + [printers]
   + [trackers]

   Any language should implement a module named [LangTracker], [LangCheck], etc...

   @see "passlib/passdesign.ml" for a global overview of the Pass System
*)

(** {6 Utils} *)

val contains_tracker : QmlAst.expr -> bool

(** {6 Printers} *)

(** Regroup some of common printer of the module [Printer] in one list .
    The ignored argument is for an optimal branching with PassHandler.

    + code
    + declaration
    + size

    TODO: some more flexibility in passhandler options so that we can export
    in this list douzen of specific printers without risking that they will
    all be printed with a --print-all.
*)
val printers : ('env -> QmlAst.annotmap * (QmlTypes.gamma * QmlTypes.gamma) * QmlAst.code) -> 'opt -> (PassHandler.printer_id * 'env PassHandler.printer) list

module Printer :
sig
  (**
     Regular ast printer:
     print the full code using the Pretty Printer of the language
     and insering multiple new lines so that meld can better do
     the correspondancy between values.
  *)
  val code : QmlAst.code PassHandler.printer

  (**
     Regular ast size printer:
     print the size of the code using opatrack conventions.
     Used by passtracker hudson.
  *)
  val size : QmlAst.code PassHandler.printer

  (**
     Outputs only the toplevel values without the bodies, like :
     {[
     type toto
     dbval ...
     a
     b
     c
     etc...
     ]}
     Usefull to have a global overview of the code, and tracking
     inserted/removed toplevel values by a pass.

     Print only the code_elt which contains at least one tracked expression
