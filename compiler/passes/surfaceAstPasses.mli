(**
  This module contains the compilation passes that are executed
  in SurfaceAst (the very front end of the compiler)
  except the parsing pass (that is available in OpaParser)
 *)

open SurfaceAstPassesTypes
open SurfaceAst

(**
   This pass looks for Package declaration of each file, and loads these
   dependencies
   The node Package is removed from the code and never appears afterwards
*)
val pass_load_objects:
  options:options ->
  (([< SurfaceAst.all_directives > `static_content `static_content_directory `static_resource `static_resource_directory ] as 'b) parsed_file list * 'b parsed_file list) ->
  ((string, 'b) SurfaceAst.code_elt ObjectFiles.parsed_code -> unit) ->
  unit

(**
   This pass goes through the whole to transform the syntactic constructions
   parsers and xml_parser into real opa code
   Parser generation happens in trx_convert.ml
   Xml_parser generation happens in xml_pattern.ml

   Assumptions: no alpha renaming yet
                no directives other than `xml_parser contains an expression in its variant

   Directives removed : [\[ `xml_parser _ \]]

   Directives added : [\[\]]
 *)
val pass_parser_generation :
  options:options ->
  (string,parsing_directive) env_both_lcodes ->
  (string, renaming_directive) env_both_lcodes


(**
   This pass alpha renames the whole code
   It takes care of renaming types, type variables, and identifiers

   Assumptions:
   - every identifier that is allowed to be unbound should be given (first argument)
     for example, git_version, or release are defined afterwards by the compiler and must be given
     in the list
   - every type identifier that is allowed to be unbound should given as
     a second argument
     tuples are a special cases: tuple_%d, where d >= 0 is automatically defined once it is used
     afterwards, a mapping from integers to the corresponding tuple identifier can be retrieved
   - no directive bind variables in their subexpression, or somehow change the scope
     there is of course a few exceptions: SurfaceAst.alpha_renaming_directive
   - no variant of a directive contains expressions, patterns, types or anything that should be renamed

   Directives removed : [SurfaceAst.alpha_renaming_directive]

   Directives added : [\[ `local \]]

val pass_check_duplication :
  string list ->
  string list ->
  options:options ->

(**
   This pass insert the definitions of tuple_%d for every use that was recorded
   by the alpha renaming pass

   Assumption: alpha renaming has been performed already
