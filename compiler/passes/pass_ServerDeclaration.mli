   This pass checks if one or several 'server' values are defined at the
   toplevel. If so, it updates the options and insert a \@server_entry_point
   directive for each 'server' value, on user code.  If a 'server' value is
   found in strandard library code, it raise an exception and stop the
   compilation.
