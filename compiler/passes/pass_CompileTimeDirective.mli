  For inserted values, we can use a extra directive, with a key in the stdlib.
  instead of inserting a identifier.

  myvariable = @compiletime("git-version")

  And we can document somewhere all available keys, so that the user may
  decide or not to introduce them in its code, and making less hacky the procedure.
