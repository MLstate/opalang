   This module gathers the passes that statically include some content
   in the source code
*)


val warning_set: WarningClass.Set.t

(**
   This pass replaces \@static_binary_content and \@static_source_content with
   the actual content of the file (in release mode, or with some code to load
   the file at run time otherwise)

   Assumptions: the files exist on the disk maybe?

   Directives removed : [\[ `static_binary_content | `static_source_content \]]

   Directives added : [\[\]]

   The type doesn't reflect that the directives have disappeared,
   see the comments at pass_collect_annotations for why it is so

(**
    This pass replaces \@static_include_directory with the construction of a
    stringmap containing a binding between filename and a tuple of the mimetype
    and the content of the file.
    Mimetype and content are resolved on separates passes, on this one, only
    directives are inserted.
    By default, only  \@static_source_content is used.

    Directives removed : [\[ `static_file_mimetype \]]

    Directives added : [\[ `static_source_content \]]
