  TODO:
  We can take advantage of the analysis for adding new warnings
  about unused patterns.
  The problem to do this there, is that it will be only on the
  client side, and the same optimisation are possible on the server
  side. Maybe after a working prototype, we can try to extract
  the analysis part, to be able to use it on the server too.
  Possible solution:
  1) Functorization
  2) Parametrized libraries
