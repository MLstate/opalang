  (**
     A type for controling field addition into a tree.
     The standard life of the tag for a tree is the following:
     -it starts [Open 0]
     -as long as fields are added to an open tree, the tree remains open,
     and grows up [Open x++]
     -a [size] guard may be added to a tree taged as [Open n], where [n <= size],
     is this case, the tag becomes :
     [Partial (n, size)] if [n < size], or [Closed size] if [n = size].
     Any other case leads to an inconsistency.
     -as long as fields are added to a partial tree, the tree remains partial,
     and grows up [Partial (current++, size)] until the limit of [size] is reached,
     in this last case, the tree becomes closed, [Closed size].

     An invariant is that the size of the tree (the FieldMap) is equal to the [current]
     value stored in the tag.
