   Note for hacker:

   Since this module is private to the jsimp compiler, the interface of this module
   is volontary too big, and export too much functions.
   The goal of this is to have an internal documentation of implementation on the
   form of a standard mli file.

type special_bool_hack = [
  | `maybebool of bool
      (**
         means that the dot should be perform with a safety runtime function
         working also on native bool.
      *)

  | `onlybool of bool
      (**
         means that the test can be performed on bool directly
      *)

      *)

   In javascript, an assignment expression is evaluated as the assigned expression.
   e.g., [x=5] is evaluated to [5]. In the generation of pattern matching, we take
   advantage of this, for computing both at the same time pattern-checking,
   and pattern-binding.

   Example, for matching a list, we will generate from:
   {[
   match e with
   | [ hd = v0 | tl = v1 ]
   | []
   ]}
   a code like:
   {[
   if ( v1 = e.tl, v1 != undefined ) {
     v0 = e.hd ;
     <right-side>;
   } else {
     <right-side> ;
   }
   ]}

   On the other hand, some js value can never be evaluated to false.
   We take also benefits of this for having shorter guards.
   Example, for list matching, we know that a list is an js object,
   and a js object is equivalent to [true] in a conditional,
   so, we will finally replace the guard
   {[
   if ( v1 = e.tl, v1 != undefined )
   ]}
   by
   {[
   if ( v1 = e.tl )
   ]}

   Details about params [assign] and [ident]
   If the ident is Some, it should necessary be the ident of the assignment.
   {[
   assign: v0 = a.x
   ident: Some v0
   ]}
   will build one of the following forms:
   {[
   (v0 = a.x, v0 != undefined)
   ]}
   {[
   (v0 = a.x, v0 == undefined)
   ]}
   {[
   v0 = a.x
   ]}
   {[
   !(v0 = a.x)
   ]}
   If the expr should not be kept in a comma, we use the assign as the ident.
   In this case, use [None] for the ident:
   {[
   assign: v0
   ident: None
   ]}
   will build one of the following forms:
   {[
   v0 != undefined
   ]}
   {[
   v0 == undefined
   ]}
   {[
   v0
   ]}
   {[
   !v0
   ]}
*)
val aux_build_guard :
  env:env ->

  ident:JsAst.ident option ->

  special_bool_hack:special_bool_hack option ->
  guard

(** {6 Nested Guard} *)

(**
   add in the current guards the necessary guard to assign and check that
   the matched expression verify the nested guard.
   Examples.
   From:
   {[
   present(m.a.b.c.d)
   ]}
   To:
   {[
   v0 = m.a &&
   v1 = v0.b &&
   v2 = v1.c &&
   v3 = v2.d
   ]}
   We use the optimization about maybe_js_false if possible, but in cases where it is not,
   it will generated something like;
   {[
   v0 = m.a && v0 != undefined &&
   v1 = v0.b && v1 != undefined &&
   v2 = v1.c && v2 != undefined &&
   v3 = v2.d && v3 != undefined.
   ]}
   We give the path concerned by the guard, and the kind of check we are talking about:
   -present
   -absent
   -const

   Important remarks:
   This function does not look into the SumEnv for previous assigment,
   this is done by the function [aux_build_decision].
   We assume that all dot asked have not yet be assigned.
   For optimizing next lookup, we should enrich the [SumEnv.t].
   <!> condition of insertion in sum env are growing up during the recursives call,
   as condition are added to the guards.

(** {6 Decisions} *)

(**
   Essentially like [build_nested_dot], but sharing already assigned variables.
   This function add to the guards the necessary checks for validating the given path.

   It is used as an auxilary function of [build_decision].
   This work directly on the  [rev_path] contained in the decision node.

  penv * menv * condition * rev_guards

(**
   Tranform a decision into a guard list.
   <!> Append to the guard list in reverse order.

   Arguments are needed for:
   -sum: for optimizing non_js_false cases.
   -sum_env: for looking for previous dots, even partially on the path
   -the current growing condition, for knowing if we are allowed to use the previous affectations,
   and for adding new ident in the SumEnv.
   This current growing condition can start from [True], because each previous case has been executed.
   So we have 2 forms of condition. The one beeing used for storing in SumEnv (starting from 0)
   and the one aggregating everything, for finding in SumEnv
   -the current field_path

(**
   Build a dot for binding.
   We assume for building this dot that the check assuring that this dot can be done without
   any check. All checks have already be done in guards.
   Use previous shared assignement.
   Some example:
   -if the rev_path is empty, this return directly the matched expression
   -if there is not any previous shared dot, it returns an nested dot:
   {[
   build_dot ~rev_path:["c"; "b"; "a"] ~matched:x
   ]}
   returns
   {[
   x.a.b.c
   ]}
*)
val build_dot :
  menv:menv ->
  matched:JsAst.expr ->
  rev_path:rev_path ->
  maybebool:bool ->
  JsAst.expr

(**
   Return elements of javascript for compiling an analysed pattern.

   The returned [cond] and [bindings] should be used in this way
   {[
   if ( cond ) {
     bindings;
     <right-side>
   } else
   if ( cond ) {
     bindings;
     <rigth-side>
   } else {
     match_failure()
   }
   ]}

   Note about minimal_condition:
   The minimal condition restart for each new pattern, but the maximal condition
   takes advantage and informations from previous matched patterns, and grows up
   from a pattern to an other. The maximal condition is in the menv

   When we are processing to the negation of condition,
   if it leads to an inconsistency, that means that the
   pattern is exhaustive.

   Static invalidation:
   if the pattern is invalidate statically, the function
   will return None, and the pattern is skipped of the code.
