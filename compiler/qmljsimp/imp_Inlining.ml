(* Inlining works roughly as described in
   http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/inlining/

   Note that it works only on generated code, and not on javascript in general
   It cannot deal with code that is too imperative. However the generated code is not
   completely functional either because the compilation of tail calls introduces some
   assignments.
   Due to this imperativeness, inlining is more complicated that what is described
   in the paper.
