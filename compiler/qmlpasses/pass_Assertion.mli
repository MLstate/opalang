   Processing assert directives
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Depending on the option --no-assert, remove assert directives, or
   rewrite them using a cond and the [\@fail] directive.

   Resolution of assert directives takes places after typing and slicing
   to avoid too much differences between the code with or without asserts,
   but is done before explicit instantiation, to avoid the introduction
   of unused type variable (used e.g. just for magic to string in assert
   error messages)

  QmlTypes.gamma -> QmlAst.annotmap -> QmlAst.code -> QmlAst.annotmap * QmlAst.code
