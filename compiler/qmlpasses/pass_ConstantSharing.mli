(**
   Pass to share constants, simple records and records with only constant fields.

(**
   This pass defines for each constant (string, float and records) used in the QML code a toplevel
   definition.
   We define a subset of QML ast to work only on the part of the ast which we are interested in.

   Then it replaces every occurrence of the constant by the corresponding
   toplevel identifier just defined.

   Example :

   {[
   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% "hello"
   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% (%%bslpervasives.string_of_float%% 2.)
   c = 2.
   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% "hello"

   is rewritten in

   {[
   v0_const = "hello"
   v1_const = 2.

   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% v0_const
   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% (string_of_int v1_const)
   c = v1_const
   _ = %%bslpervasives.print_endline%% v0_const
   ]}
   The constants ["hello"] and [2.] are now shared thanks to the
   declaration of two variables at the beginnning of the code.

   For debuging, and choosing what kind of constant to share,
   cf constant_sharing_* debug variables.

   Beware, part of the env is mutable, which does not allow
   to use this module as purelly functionnal with diverge.
