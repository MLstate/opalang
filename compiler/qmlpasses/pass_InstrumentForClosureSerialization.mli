   The transformation related to closure serialization is as follows:

   --- Source code
   f(x:list) =
     g(y) = (x,y)
     (g,g(1))

   --- After the early lambda lifting
   g(x,y) = (x,y)
   f(x) =
     (@partial_apply(g(x)),g(x,1))

   --- After instrumentation by this pass
   g(x,y) = (x,y)
   g'(x) = @partial_apply(g(x),@typeof(x))
   f(x) =
     (g'(x),g(x,1))

   --- After ei
   g(x,y) = (x,y)
   g'(ty,x) = @partial_apply(g(x),list(ty))
   f(ty,x) =
    (g'(ty,x),g(x,1))

   --- After closures, assuming no cps:
   g(x,y) = (x,y)
   clos_g = %%closure_create%%(g,2,true)
   g'(ty,x) = %%closure_apply_env_with_ty%%(clos_g,@llarray(x),@llarray(list(ty)))
   // no need to create a closure for g', it is the code that creates the closures
   f(ty,x) =
     (g'(ty,x),g(x,1))
   clos_f = %%closure_create%%(f,2,true)


   And the more complicated case, where the lifted function is recursive through its closure:
   --- Source code
   id(x) = x
   f(x:list) =
     rec g(y) = if true then x else id(g)(y)
     g

   --- After early ll
   id(x) = x
   rec g(x,y) = if true then x else id(@partial_apply(g(x)))(y)
   f(x) =
     @partial_apply(g(x))

   --- After instrumentation
   id(x) = x
   rec g(x,y) = if true then x else id(g'(x))(y)
   and g'(x) = @partial_apply(g(x),OpaType.ty,@typeof(x)) // tricky case, we must anticipate
                                                          // the addition of a typevar by ei
   f(x) = g'(x)

   --- After ei
   id(x) = x
   rec g(ty,x,y) = if true then x else id(g'(ty,x))(y)
   and g'(ty,x) = @partial_apply(g(ty,x),OpaType.ty,list(ty))
   f(ty,x) = g'(ty,x)

   --- After closures:
   id(x) = x
   clos_id(x) = %%closure_create%%(id,1,true)
   clos_g = %% closure_create_no_function%%(3,true)
   rec g(ty,x,y) = if true then x else @clos_apply(id(g'(ty,x)),y)
   and g'(ty,x) = %%closure_apply_env_with_ty%%(clos_g,@llarray(ty,x),@llarray(OpaType.ty,list(ty)))
   f(ty,x) = g'(ty,x)
