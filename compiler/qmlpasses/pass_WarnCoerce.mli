   This pass is used after Typing for ensuring that some expressions have
   an expected type.
   Typically, we use this pass for cheking if an expression after a [do]
   has the type [void].
   In case the expression has not the given type, the pass_WarnCoerce raise
   a warning of the class typer.warncoerce. This class can be turned on --warn-error.

   The directives is keeped, it will be removed in the PurgeTyperDirective pass,
   with the other typer directives.
