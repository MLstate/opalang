   Resolution of coding directives.
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Coding directives are directives used for maintenance, and or readability of the opa source code.
   These are directives put by developpers, for other developpers.
   Here is the list of handled directives, and their effect during this pass:

   \@deprecated
   A warning will be produced at all direct utilisation of a deprecated construction.
   The directive is skipped.

   \@todo
   A warning will be produced at all direct utilisation of an unimplemented construction.
   The directive is simply replaced by a \@fail directive.
   The purpose of this directive is to be used combined with the activation of the warn-error
   class coding.todo, for detecting every unimplemented constructions.
