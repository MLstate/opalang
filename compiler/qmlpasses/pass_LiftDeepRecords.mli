(**
   This module implements a pass to lighten deep record expressions

   @author Esther Baruk
*)

(**
   What this pass does :
   it goes deep into a record expression and when the maximum depth is reached,
   expressions contained in the record are lifted into let-bindings which are
   inserted just before the record expression.

   Example :
   {[
   r =
     { hd =
           { hd =
                 { hd =
                       { hd = { hd = "foo" ; tl = { nil = { } } };
                         tl = { hd = "bar" ; tl = { nil = { } } }
                       };
                   tl = { nil = { } }
                };
             tl = { nil = { } }
           };
       tl = { nil = { } }
     }
   ]}

   is rewritten in

   {[
   r =
     v0_r = { }
     v1_r = { nil = v0_r }
     v2_r = "foo"
     v3_r = { hd = v2_r ; tl = v1_r }
     v4_r = { }
     v5_r = { nil = v4_r }
     v6_r = "bar"
     v7_r = { hd = v6_r ; tl = v5_r }
     v8_r = { hd = v3_r ; tl = v7_r }
     v9_r = { }
     v10_r = { nil = v9_r }
     { hd =
         { hd = { hd = v8_r ; tl = v10_r };
           tl = { nil = { } }
         };
       tl = { nil = { } }
     }
   ]}
