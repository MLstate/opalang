   [Pass_Uncurry] takes a lambda lifted code with eta expanded bypass
   and adds directive @closure_create and @closure_apply in the code
   that [Pass_Closure] with replace with actual code

   assumptions:
   renaming (identifiers are uniquely defined)
   lambda lifting has been done
   hoisting of bypass has been done
