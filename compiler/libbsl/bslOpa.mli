   Specific bsl processing for Opa files.

   This module implements part of the bslregister process.

(**
   Bsl Preprocessing for Opa files.

   Essentially, it is about producing generated declaration.
   {[
   ##include functions bslpervasives
   ]}
   will produce a code like :
   {[
   `+` = %%bslpervasives.add_int%% : int, int -> int
   ...
   etc...
   ]}

   The final bymap should have been built at the end of all registering
   of bypass, or some inclusion may be unsuccessfull.

val preprocess :
  final_bymap:BslLib.BSL.ByPassMap.t -> BslDirectives.opalang_decorated_file -> (filename * FBuffer.t)


type true_means_error = bool

(**
   This performs checks on the bsl opa.
   All errors log are produced using OManager channel.

   It makes no OManager errors, or does not raise any exception,
   just logs errors using citation if possible,
   and returns at the end a bool indicating
   if some errors was encounted during the checking.
   [true] means errors.

   {[
   if checking_fail ~final_bymap opa_codes then
     !! the opa in the bsl is buggy !!
   else
     (* everything is ok *)
   ]}

   The function returns also the typed opa interfaces,
   produces after typing.

   The filenames should be preserved.
