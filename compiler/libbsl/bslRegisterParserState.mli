(**
   Private imperative state for the BslRegiserParser.

   @author Mathieu Barbin
   @author Mehdi Bouaziz
*)

(**
   This module contains some global variables for being set,
   and interracting with the [BslRegisterParser]
*)

(** {6 Type alias, for lisibility} *)

type filename       = string
type line_number    = int

(** {6 Imperative State} *)
(**
   BslRegisterLib uses the parser in a [File.lines_fold_i],
   and send to trx only a small part of the file (one line,
   or a few, with [##{] and [}##] directives : TODO)
*)

(**
   The function tells the parser what {b file} it is actually beeing parsed.
*)
val init_file : filename:filename -> unit

(**
   The function tells the parser what {b line} of the current file
   it is beeing parsed.
   It also resets the scope of TypeVariables.
*)
val init_line : line_number:line_number -> unit

(**
   For building correctly the contents of the directive [Args],
   the parser should memorize the last parsed directive in a bypass
   file.
*)
(** *)
val set_last_directive : BslDirectives.bypasslang_directive -> unit
val get_last_directive : unit -> BslDirectives.bypasslang_directive option

(** {6 Positions} *)

(**
   Building a position from the current position of the Parser.
   It uses the state of the global private variables for knowing
   the context of the parsing.
*)
val make_pos : unit -> FilePos.pos

(**
   A pprinter for the current position of the Parser.
   It uses the state of the global variables for knowing
   the context of the parsing.
*)
val pp_citation : Format.formatter -> unit -> unit

(** {6 Types Variables} *)

module TypeVar :
sig
  (**
     Build a typevar from the parsed name.
     <!> depends on the scope.
  *)
  val var : string -> BslTypes.typevar

  (**
     Used only in case you do not have the name, for anonymous typevariables only : [_]
  *)
  val fresh : unit -> BslTypes.typevar

  (**
     This reset the scope of typevars.
     This function is called by init_line, but is exported in the API if needed.
  *)
  val reset : unit -> unit
end

(** {6 Errors and Warnings} *)

(**
   Both errors and warnings uses the citation corresponding
   to the current context.
*)

(**
   The error uses OManager.error
*)
val error : ('a, 'b) OManager.oformat -> 'a

(**
   The warning uses the wclass [bsl.register].
*)
val warning : ('a, unit) OManager.oformat -> 'a
