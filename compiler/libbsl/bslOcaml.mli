   Specific bsl processing for Ocaml files.

   This module implements part of the bslregister process.

(**
   Bsl Preprocessing for Ocaml files.

   This function is called at the end, once we have parsed all ocaml files,
   the fonction implements a fold on decorated_files, for building
   the runtime and the wanted interface (for checking).

   The function should also perform calls to the Register API,
   given as a record of type [BslPluginInterface.dynloader_interface],
   which contains support for registering types and primitives.

   The preprocess should respect the module hiearchy and keys names,
   for beeing coherent with Js, but the actual implementation is free,
   as long as the generated ml_runtime and ml_runtime_mli are coherent
   with the impl used as argument for calling the dynload interface.
