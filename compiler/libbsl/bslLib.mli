   TODO: defunc.
   Although it brings type safety about its manipulation,
   it is too complex.

   The table should be shared between different instance of back-end,
   since we have a lot of backends with which we may choose to togle
   dynamically.

(* Implementation Note :
   the modules in the implementation can share the abstract types because
   there is no coercion of module there,
   until the final compilation of the module BslLib *)
