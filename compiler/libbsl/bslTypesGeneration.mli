(**
   Module for macro generating bsl types coercions and definitions.

   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   This module implements the traduction of bsl-types into the back-end languages.
   It has also a module dedicated to Opa syntax for bsl-preprocessing (cf [iformats]).

   TODO:
   Currently, we output code only as concrete syntax (Ocaml, Js).
   It is really usefull to have dedicated printers for BslTypes,
   because we can make some specific control for external primitives
   printing and error messages,
   but for code generation, it would be better to pass through an
   AST generation.
   Some (sunny) day we will add an implemention for AST production.

   + when OcamlAst will be more stable.
   + when JsAst will be more stable.
   + when we will decide what we do with LLVM, and have a AST for extern C bindings.

     Printer for [t] with the ocaml syntax.

     This function is the kernel of the type checking done
     on the [MLRuntime], because it produces types coercions
     from the types read in the register directives.

     cf: BslServerLib.S

     The scope of type variables is fresh for every call to pp.

     At some we did some tests for targetting llvm.
     This is currently unused, and unmaintain, and this is
     probably no more corresponding to anything we will keep.

     This is partially not implemented and not supported by
     any back-end.

     @deprecated Wait for LLVM backend.
