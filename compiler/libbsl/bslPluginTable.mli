(**
   The imperative table where bsl pugins are stored.

*)

(**
   Store a plugin in the table. Do not register any bypass yet anywhere,
   just put the plugin in the common table.
*)
val store : BslPluginInterface.plugin -> unit

(**
   Get a plugin from the common table by its name. None means a
   plugin with no name (i.e., a bundled plugin).
*)
val get : string option -> BslPluginInterface.plugin option

(**
   The finalization will check if the dependancies of plugins are satisfied.
   Example scenario : You have built a plugin [libB] using an other plugin [libA],
   with a command like :
   {[
   $ bslregister -o libB myfile.ml myfile2.ml libA.opp
   ]}
   And then, you try to compile an opa file which uses some primitives from libB :
   {[
   $ opa.exe libB.opp myfile.opa
   ]}
   Then, you'll get an error when you finalize the plugin table, because the plugin
   [libB] was built with a dependencie to the [libA], and you try to use
   the [libB] without loading the [libA].

   Add:
   {[
   $ opa.exe libB.opp libA.opp myfile.opa
   ]}

   Order of storing does not make any importance, the plugin are topologically sorted during the finalization,
   and then returned in a topologic order in the returned list.

   @error using standard OManager
*)
val finalize : unit -> BslPluginInterface.plugin list

(**
   Returns the last result returned by [finalize], but without refinalizing.
   If [finalize] was never called, returns [None]
*)
val last_finalize : unit -> BslPluginInterface.plugin list option

(**
   Clear
