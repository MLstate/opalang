(**
   Dynamic loading of bypass plugin files.

   Bypass plugins are used to introduce custom primitives in an opa code.
   For the compiler {b opa.exe}, like types, implementation, etc..

   Bypass plugins are built with the application {b bslregister},
   and then used by any of the following applications :
   + bslregister (to link a plugin with a previous one)
   + bslbrowser (to browse the primitives of a plugin)
   + qmlcompilers (to link a qml file with some custom primitives)
   + opa.exe (to link a opa file with some custom primitives)

(** This function does a side effect on the BslPluginTable,
    by registering all definitions of bypass of the given plugin.

val load_bypass_plugin : bypass_plugin_file -> unit

(** an alias for [!BslDynlink.load_bypass_plugin] for being as close as possible of the function
    [Dynlink.load_bypass_plugin] from ocaml standard library

val loadfile_private : bypass_plugin_file -> unit

(**
   Same than [loadfile_private] but does nothing if the bypass_plugin_fille was already loaded.
   This is used for avoiding to reload, or to re deserialize plugins several times, for
   optimizing the time taken by the pass BslLoading

val load_bypass_plugin_cache : bypass_plugin_file -> unit

(**
    Reset the cache

   This module uses [OManager] for its errrors.
