(**
   These convention are shared knowledge between opa-plugin-* (bsl{register,browser}) and the Opa compiler,
   for simplifying plugin inclusion.

     Extensions produced for plugins.

  type extension = string
  val bypass : extension
  val jsconf : extension
  val plugin : extension

module Suffix :

     Given the name of the lib and adding these suffix, gives the name of the corresponding file,
     <!> without the extension.
  *)

  type suffix = string
  val nodejspackage : suffix
  val jskeys : suffix
  val loader : suffix
  val marshalplugin : suffix

*)
type inclusion = {

     An absolute path name to a directory to include
  *)

   Given the location of an plugin directory (opp), return
   the list of implied options.
   If the location is relative, will prefix it by the current
   working directory.
