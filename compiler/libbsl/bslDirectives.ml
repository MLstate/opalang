   Definition of register directives for building external primitives libraries.

   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   This module defines the type of the preprocess directives you can find in
   the different files given to {b bslregister}, for example :
   {[
   ##register myfun : int, string -> string
   ]}

   As a complement, see also the module [BslTags.t] which manage only the optionnal
   parameters for directives :
   {[
   ##register [tag:attribute] ....
   like in :
   ##register [noprojection] ....
   ]}

   For extanding tags, it is really easy, you just have to modify 1 file : BslTags.

   For extanding directives, it is a little bit more work, you have to modify this
   file, the parser of course, and all implementation of Generation for any language.

   {9 IncludeType}

   A directive for producing all types definitions matching a regexp.
   A typical example, is to include all type from a given path

   {[
   ##extern-type mymodule.*
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   IncludeType "mymodule.*"
   ]}

   {9 Include}

   Inclusion preprocess is a mechanism for producting directly code from
   bypass definitions, without rewritting the code with the type manually.

   ##include <format> path
   ]}

(** Directives in doc-like js syntax *)
module Js = struct

(** There are two possible ways of defining a bypass. The first one,
    which corresponds to the use of ##register + ##args in the classic
    syntax, is by adding a function or variable definition after the
    register directive.

    Example:

    ##register foo : int -> int
    ##args(bar)
    {
        return bar + 4;
    }

    ->

    /**
     * @register {int -> int}
     */
    function foo(bar) {
        return bar + 4;
    }

    The second one corresponds to inline definitions, which are done
    by adding the inline definition in the directive itself:

    ##register foo \ my_foo : int -> int

    ->

    /**
     * @register {int -> int} foo my_foo
     */

    The former is given by the Regular constructor, while the latter
    is given by the Inline constructor.

*)

  type definition =
  | Regular of JsIdent.t
  | Inline of string

  type t =
  | BslSide of [`client | `server | `both]
  | ExternalTypeDef of skey * BslTypes.typevar list
  | OpaTypeDef of skey * BslTypes.typevar list
  | Module of skey
  | EndModule
  | Register of skey * definition * BslTypes.t

end

(**
   {9 ExternTypeDef}

   A extern type definition.

   This makes actually sense only in Ocaml files.
   It introduces a new ocaml type.

   {[
   ##extern-type ('a, 'b, 'c) toto = Ka of 'a | Kb of 'b | Kc of 'c
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   ExternTypeDef ("toto", ['a ; 'b ; 'c], "Ka of 'a | Kb of 'b | Kc of 'c")
   ]}

   @see "BslTypesGeneration.Ocaml" to see how this type is defined in opa, and how it is printed
   in the [ml] and [mli] of the generated [MLRuntime]

   {9 Module}

   {[
   ##module skey \ impl_name
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   Module ("skey", "impl_name")
   ]}

   {9 EndModule}

   For closing a module previously open.

   Syntax:
   {[
   ##endmodule
   ]}

   {9 Register}

   For defining a new primitive.
   + The name of the key can be different than the name of the primitive in the
   target language.
   + The primitive can be injected from an existing implementation. In this case,
   the implementation will be directly injected in the generated code. (cf Syntax 3)

   Syntax 1:
   {[
   ##register skey : int, int -> int
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   Register ("skey", "skey", false, BslTypes.(int, int -> int))
   ]}

   Syntax 2:
   {[
   ##register skey \ different_name : int, int -> int
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   Register ("skey", "different_name", false, BslTypes.(int, int -> int))
   ]}

   Syntax 3:
   {[
   ##register skey \ `Pervasives.(+)` : int, int -> int
   ]}
   is represented as :
   {[
   Register ("skey", "Pervasives.(+)", true, BslTypes.(int, int -> int))
   ]}

   This is the only case where the injected bool is set to [true]
