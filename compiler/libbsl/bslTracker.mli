   Some utils related to Pass Tracking for Bypasses.
   @author Quentin Bourgerie
*)

(**
   This module defines some utils for branching compilers working on QmlAst with
   the pass tracking system developed in passlib, in [PassHandler] and [PassTracker]

   In particular, it defines, given a [QmlAst.code] extractor some :
   + [printers]
   + [trackers]

   Any language should implement a module named [LangTracker], [LangCheck], etc...

   @see "passlib/passdesign.ml" for a global overview of the Pass System
*)

(** {6 Printers} *)

(** Regroup some of common printer of the module [Printer] in one list .
    The ignored argument is for an optimal branching with PassHandler.

    + bymap
*)
val printers : ('env -> BslLib.env_bsl) -> 'opt -> (PassHandler.printer_id * 'env PassHandler.printer) list

module Printer :
sig
  (**
     Regular bymap printer:
     print all keys of bypasses
  *)
  val bymap : BslLib.env_bsl PassHandler.printer

end
