(**
   Map based on equality on [BslTypes.t] under normalization.

   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   Two types equal under alphaconversion are equal regarding to
   the comparaison used to build this map.

   If you need a structural comparaison, cf [BslTypesMap].

   Beware, this Map is particulary unefficient.
   However, the efficiency can be optimized if needed (cf TODO in
   comments in the implementation of [BslTypes.compare ~normalize:true])
*)

include BaseMapSig.S with type key = BslTypes.t
