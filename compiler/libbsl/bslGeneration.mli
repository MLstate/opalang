   Wrapper around BslRegisterLib to make it easier to call from outside code.

   Most of this file used to be part of bslregister.ml. This was
   refactor to make it easier to call the plugin compiler from the
   rest of the code.

      Loader file.  these files are used to link statically a plugin
      with an executable, so that there is no need to load dynamically
      a .bypass file for being able to load bypasses of a given plugin.

      Currently, the static mode is used only for the opabsl, and the
      resulting plugin is linked with opa.exe
