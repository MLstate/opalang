(**
   Given a string list of possible choices of ident,
   and an ident, returns the proposition list
   where the propositions have been sorted so that
   the first elt is the closest to the searched name, etc...

   This code was initially somewhere in opa,
   but is cool, and may be used by more modules.

   If the propositions list is empty, the returned
   list will be empty.
