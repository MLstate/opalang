(**
   Abtract type of annotation, for decorated AST.
*)

(**
   Some recent benches have shown that the indirection introduced by having a record
   {[{ e : expr ; annot : annot }]}
   for manipulating the AST is less efficient that having the annotation as
   field0 of the constructors. (allocation, GC, etc.)
   {[
   K of annot * arg1 * arg2 * etc.
   ]}

   In an other side, AnnotMaps in libqmlcompil are much too complex, and correspond
   to a louable (but partially deprecated) effort to follow the complexe needs of several
   versions of hacky typers.

   Finally, the experience has shown that positions are very important, and can
   have a special traitement to be sure that we do have always a position for warnings,
   error messages, etc.

   This module is a proposition for reacting to these remarks.
   The changes in the framework are considerable in term of portion of code touched,
   but it is just a matter of time (no fondamental difficulty).

type t

(**
   The comparaison on [t]

val compare : t -> t -> int

(**
   equality on [t]

val equal : t -> t -> bool

   Get a string representation of the annot. Injective.

   FIXME: document there why we need to transform an annot into a int.
   If there is no good reason, the function should not be exported

module AnnotSet : BaseSetSig.S with type elt = t

(** {6 AST} *)

(**
   Originally defined in QmlLoc, the type [label] regroups in a record a position, and an annot.
   This type is meant to be used as field0 of Konstructors of AST.
   {[
   type ast =
     | K1 of label * arg1 * arg2 * etc.
     | K2 of label * args * etc.
   ]}

   It will lead to have an underscore in pattern matching, most of the time,
   but it is the price to pay for removing the indirection [.expr, .annot] which is
   not better to manipulate for deep patterns.

   Note:
   We could also have had a version :
   {[
   type ast =
     | K1 of pos * annot * arg1 * arg2 * etc.
     | K2 of pos * annot * args * etc.
   ]}
   but the couple (pos * annot) is not often separatly refreshed, so it brings probably nothing
   in term of performances, but make 2 underscore in patterns instead of 1.

(**
   The type used for positions : defined in module [FilePos]
*)
type pos = FilePos.pos

(**
   The type label.
   + annot : A unique annotation.
   + pos : The position in the source, produced by the parser, or empty for generated code.
*)
type label

val pos : label -> pos
val annot : label -> t
val make_label : t -> pos -> label

(**
   Fresh label, with a fresh annot.
*)
val next_label : pos -> label

(**
   Fresh label, with the same pos
*)
val refresh : label -> label

(**
   Frehs annot, with a [no_pos] positions.
   Should be used only for compatibility with old code.
   The string is an indication to the path to the function which
   build the label.
*)
val nolabel : string -> label

(**
   If your AST follows guidelines about label, you can use these functions,
   by reexporting them in a mli for restricting the type ['ast] to your AST.

   The guidelines is the following :
   The type ['a] should have a [label] in its [field0]

     Same than [new_pos] in term of allocation, but merge the old pos and the new pos.
