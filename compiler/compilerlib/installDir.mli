(**
   Install directories
*)

(**
   The install directory is where libs have been installed.
   This directory is needed by opa to compile applications.

   The location of this directory is pointed by an environment var,
   which use to be one of the following vars:
   MLSTATELIBS, OPADIR, (used to be also BASEDIR), whatever...

   We will now stabilize the build process, and choose only 1 name for this variable.
   There we do a toplevel getenv, and then in any other place in the compiler,
   we should refer to this value.
*)

(**
   Currently "MLSTATELIBS"
   This is used for generating e.g. Makefile, without duplicating the string
   in the code of the compiler.
*)
val name : string

(**
   This is the value of the installdir variable, returned once for all
   by a getenv executed at toplevel of this module.
*)
val getenv : string Lazy.t

(**
   The path into the install dir to find the lib of the Opa compiler.
   Without the first '/', the current value is ["lib/opa/static"]
*)
val lib_opa : string

(**
   The path into the install dir to find the compiled opa packages of the stdlib.
   The current value is ["lib/opa/stdlib"]

val opa_packages : string
