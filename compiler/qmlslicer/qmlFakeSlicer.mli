   - Job:
     This pass discards bypasses that are not defined in the current language
     If they are really called at runtime, an exception will be thrown

   - Precond:
     It assumes bypass hoisting has occurred

   - Goal:
     It is intended for tests, because when the code is not sliced you end up with client bypasses
     in your server code or vice versa.

   - More precise description of the job:
     More precisely, non functional values are treated this way:
     [x = \@expanded_bypass(%%max_int%%)
      f() = x] becomes
     [x(_) = error("max_int was called")
      f() = x()]
     And functional values are treated this way:
     [bypass(x,y) = \@expanded_bypass(%%something%%(x,y))]
     becomes
     [bypass(_,_) = error("bypass something was called")]
