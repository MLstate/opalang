(**
   Error management constructor for a Language treated by a compiler.

*)

(* This module has no mli because it would duplicate the module type sig LangContext *)

(** {6 Design note} *)

(**
   This module is meant to factorize code to create located error messages, for a
   public or an internal audience for any language Lang following the design.

   This module uses internally the [passlib] which offers the opportunity to passes
   and checkers to be more verbose and outputting a detailed context in the
   track system, which can be analyzed after the compilation (or after the last error),
   using [opatrack]
*)

module type LangContext =
sig
  (** {6 Context} *)

  (**
     The type of the context of the error.

     The type context will not be private after the functor application,
     we use a context constructor
  *)
  type context

  (**
     The printer of your context. Print everything possible from the context.
     Example: the expr, the toplevel expr in which the expr is, etc...
  *)
  val full : context PassHandler.printer

  (**
     The reduced printer for the console. Example: only filename, line
  *)
  val console : context PassHandler.printer
end


module LangError (C : LangContext) =
struct

  (**
     The documentation of theses function is in PassHandler
     They have the same names, there are just partially applied
     to the context printer.
  *)

  (** Checkers *)

  let check_fail c =
    PassHandler.check_fail ~full:C.full ~console:C.console c
  let scheck_fail c =
    PassHandler.scheck_fail ~full:C.full ~console:C.console c

  (* TODO: finish and clarify the role of full/console in public errors *)
  (* Make sure every errors in qml/opa use the corresponding LangError *)
