    Provides all checks on Opa for pre/post conditions.

(** {6 Guidelines} *)

(**
    If you wish to write a new implementation of a checker :
    + Use [OpaError.check_fail] or [OpaError.scheck_fail] functions
    + Do not use [scond_violation], [cond_violation], [i_error] or [i_serror],
    those are for passes only (not checkers).
    + All checks in this module should use the internal error system with the
    warnings related to conditions.
    + There is no interaction between [OManager] and this module
    Function there should not perform direct calls to [OManager], but to the
    overlayer defined in OpaError.
    + You should never use [flush_error] like a function
    + please keep alphabetical order of modules and functions inside modules.
    + You should necessarly export the id of conditions.

    Follow this schema :

    in WarningClass :
    {[
    val cond_category_subcategory_name : wclass
    ]}

    There :
    {[
    module Category =
    struct
      module Subcategory =
      struct
        let name_id = PassHandler.define_cond WarningClass.cond_category_subcategory_name
        let name = .... PassHandler.make_condition name_id ...
      end
    end
    ]}

    For more informations, you can refer to [passlib/passdesign.ml] which contains a reference
    implementation for this module.

   The type of all checkers. Take an extractor and computes some checks in it.
   In case of errors, the check should use functions from [OpaError] only.

   @see "WarningClass" for the corresponding definitions of warning classes

type ('env, 'a) checker = ('env -> 'a) -> 'env PassHandler.cond

(** Checks related to identifiers *)
module Ident :
sig
  (** Checks whether an identifier is unbound or not

      + Condition name : ["cond.ident.unbound"]
      + Warning class : [cond_ident_unbound]
  *)
  (* TODO *)
  val unbound : ('env, (SurfaceAst.nonuid, SurfaceAst.all_directives) SurfaceAst.code) checker
end
