   Some utils related to Pass Tracking for Opa.
*)

(** This module defines some utils for branching compilers working on
    OpaAst (SurfaceAst) with the pass tracking system developed in
    passlib, in [PassHandler] and [PassTracker]

    In particular, it defines, given a [SurfaceAst.code] extractor some :
    + [printers]
    + [trackers]

    Any language should implement a module named [LangTracker],
    [LangCheck], etc...

    @see "passlib/passdesign.ml" for a global overview of the Pass
    System
*)
(** {6 Printers} *)

(** Regroup some of common printer of the module [Printer] in one list .
    The ignored argument is for an optimal branching with PassHandler.

    + code

    TODO: some more flexibility in passhandler options so that we can
    export in this list douzen of specific printers without risking
    that they will all be printed with a --print-all.
