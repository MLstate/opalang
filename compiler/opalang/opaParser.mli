(**
   High-level interface to the opa parser.
*)

(**
   This module defines a higher-level interface for calling the trx opa parser.
   It defines as well utils using cache, and reports errors using located messages.
*)

(** {6 Types Alias} *)

(**
   Just for clarty, to avoid confusion between filenames, contents, etc...
*)
type filename = string
type contents = string

type nonuid = SurfaceAst.nonuid

(** {6 Meta-informations} *)

(**
   Hash of all trx, ml and mli use to generate the parser
   Currently : general/surfaceAst.ml and passes/syntax/*.{trx,ml}.
   Used in particular to know if the cache are relevant from a compilation
   of the compiler to an other.
*)
val hash : string

(** {6 Low-Level Parsing} *)

(**
   These function are just a call to the trx parser.
   They may raise [Trx_runtime.SyntaxError].
   [ll_] stands for [low_level].

   The given filename is optional, and given to trx, used for errors messages only.
*)

val ll_expr :  ?filename:filename -> contents -> (nonuid, SurfaceAst.parsing_directive) SurfaceAst.expr
val ll_ty :  ?filename:filename -> contents -> nonuid SurfaceAst.ty
val ll_code : ?filename:filename -> contents -> (nonuid, SurfaceAst.parsing_directive) SurfaceAst.code

(** {6 High-level Parsing} *)

(**
   These function catch the trx runtime error and print a citation of the source,
   before exiting using the function [error] (TODO: use OManager).
*)

val expr : ?filename:filename -> contents -> (nonuid, SurfaceAst.parsing_directive) SurfaceAst.expr
val ty :  ?filename:filename -> contents -> nonuid SurfaceAst.ty

(**
   Used with [cache:true], the function will set/get a cache of the parsed AST from
   [{mlstate_dir}/opa/cache/parser].
   (Default is [cache:false])
*)
val code : ?cache:bool -> ?filename:filename -> ?sugar:bool -> contents -> (nonuid, SurfaceAst.parsing_directive) SurfaceAst.code

(** {6 Deprecated API} *)

(**
   The rest of the API was done before the introduction of guidelines.
   Please do not use in new code.
*)

exception No_such_file of string

   [parse_file filename]

   @raise No_such_file The given filename cannot be read
