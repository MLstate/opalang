(** {6 Optimizing Ocaml code} *)

(**
 * Tries to optimize the code (without affecting its semantics).
 * For now it only does a couple of simplifications of match
 * expressions such as:
 *
 * [1]
 * match [EXPR] with
 * | [V1] -> [V1]     ->   [EXPR]
 * | ...
 * | [Vn] -> [Vn]
 *
 * [2]
 * match [EXPR] with       match e with
 * | [V] -> [V]       ->   | [V] as E -> E
 * | ...                   | ...
 *
 * [3]
 * match match [EXPR] with                           match [EXPR] with
 *       | A(a1, ..., an) -> B(e_b1, ..., e_bn)      | A(a1, ..., an) -> let (b1, ..., bn) = (e_b1, ..., e_bn) in X
 *       | C(c1, ..., cn) -> D(e_d1, ..., e_dn)  ->  | C(c1, ..., cn) -> let (c1, ..., cn) = (e_c1, ..., e_cn) in Y
 * with
 * | B(b1, ..., bn) -> X
 * | D(d1, ..., dn) -> Y
 *
 * All are needed for TRX code generation.
 *   But in the future more optimizations may be added so it's good
 * to apply this functions to your generated code so that it can
 * benefit from them as they come.
