(**
   Some printers for Ocaml, a Fast and a Pretty.

   @author Adrien Jonquet
   @author Mathieu Barbin
*)

(**
   This module offers a few implementations for printing some ocaml code.

   <!> Important note : please README

   Since the AST of ocaml is a mess, and should be rewrited,
   all cases of the current are not implemented in any printer.
   Only cases used by back-ends are supported. The rest of cases
   should be implemented only once we will have the new AST.
*)

(** {6 Benches} *)

(**
   Valentin did some benches and get to the fact that :

   + if [t] is the time used to print a code without only output_string
   + [2*t] would be the time using [Printf] like functions
   + [4*t] would be the time using [Format] for a pretty printer, using boxes and indentation directives
   + [unknown] with FBuffer
   + [infinite] using string concatenation

   More benches are welcome.
*)

(**
   Fonctorization, for instance using :
   + Buffer
   + FBuffer
   + Formats without formatting
   + out_channel
*)
module type Printer =

(** {6 Ident printing} *)

val ident : Ident.t -> string

(** {6 Efficient printing} *)

(**
   This printer is used whenever you do not care about the look of the printed code.
   It's main quality reside in the fact that it prints directly in an [output_channel],
   without neither with parsing some format.
*)

module Output : Printer with type t = out_channel

(** {6 Unformated printing, with Buffer interface} *)

module Buf : Printer with type t = Buffer.t

(** {6 Unformated printing, with Format interface} *)

(**
   If you need a format interface for outputting code,
   but you do not care of layout. (no formatting)
*)
module Fmt : Printer with type t = Format.formatter

module FBuf : Printer with type t = FBuffer.t ref

(**
   Extra module, backward compatibility only (netweb)
*)
module Deprecated :
sig
  type 'a printer = FBuffer.t -> 'a -> FBuffer.t
  val const_expr : Ocaml.const_expr printer
  val type_expr : Ocaml.type_expr printer
end

(** {9 Utils} *)

type 'a pprinter = 'a LangPrint.pprinter

(**
   This is just like LangPrint.pp_parameters, but with an Ocaml syntax.
*)
val pp_parameters :
  'a pprinter ->
  string ->
  'a list pprinter

(** {9 Pretty printer} *)

(**
   Only if strictly needed !
   This printer is implemented using Format and object inheritance.
