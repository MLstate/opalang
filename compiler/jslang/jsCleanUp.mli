   Performs a few simplifications on the ast
   Right now, removes dummy bindings [x = x]
   and the part of sequences that don't do side effects
   [(x = 1, y = y, y)] becomes [(x = 1, y)]
   does some constant folding etc.

   @param use_shortcut_assignment when set, shortens a = a + 1 in a++ for instance
                                  (local inlining does not deal with +=, ++, etc.)
