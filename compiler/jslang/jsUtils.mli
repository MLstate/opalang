   Native ident analysis.
   Replace local native ident to global native ident when they are not
   local to the considered code elt.
*)
val globalize_native_ident : JsAst.code_elt -> JsAst.code_elt

(**
   Prefix every global identifier by "global.". Converts declarations
   so that they still make sense, i.e.

     var foo = bar; -> global.foo = bar;

   Handle also corner cases such as replacing a real export

     exports.foo = foo; -> global.foo = foo;
*)
val export_to_global_namespace : JsAst.code -> JsAst.code

(**
   Collect all variable declarations in code and export them,
   e.g.
{[
      var foo = { bar: 1 };

      function hello(name) {
          console.log("Hello", name);
      }

   becomes

      var foo = { bar: 1 };

      function hello(name) {
          console.log("Hello", name);
      }

      exports.foo = foo;
      exports.hello = hello;
]}
   Note that this currently doesn't work for exporting variables
   that can change, e.g. a variable that holds a number whose value
   changes during program execution. However, it does work with objects,
   like in the above example
