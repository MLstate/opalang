The database
============

Database operations are fully integrated in the Opa language, which
increases code re-usability, simplifies code coverage tests, and permits both
automated optimizations and automated safety, security and sanity checks.

In this chapter, we describe the constructions of Opa dedicated to storage
of data and manipulation of stored data.

Declaring a database
--------------------

The core notion of the database is that of a _path_. A database _path_ describes
a position in the database and it is through a path that you can read, write and
remove data.

A database is named and consists of a set of declared paths. Moreover Opa handles several
database backends; currently:
- *MongoDb*: The popular MongoDB database ([http://www.mongodb.org/](http://www.mongodb.org/));
- *Db3*: The native Opa database which allows for rapid prototyping of applications.

The following piece of code declares a database named `my_db` and defines :
- 3 paths containing basic values (/i, /f, /s)
- 1 path containing a record (/r)
- 1 path containing a list of strings
- 1 path to a map from integers (`intmap`) to values of type `stored`.
- 1 path to a database set of `stored` records, where the primary key of the declared set is `x`.

    type stored = {int x, int y, string v, list(string) lst}

    // where _db\_options_ allows to select the database backend, see below
    database my_db [db_options] {
      int    /basic/i
      float  /basic/f
      string /basic/s
      stored /r
      intmap(stored) /imap
      stored /set[{x}]
    }

### Choosing database backend

Database backend depends on presence and value of `db_options`:
- `@mongo`: selects MongoDb backend
- `@db3` value selects Db3 backend
- If the db_options is omitted, the selected backend depends on the compiler '--database' command line option, with `Db3` being the default (soon to be changed to MongoDB).

### Initializing database

Opa applications can use several databases with several different backends.
For each database a command line family is generated. When running your
applications you can specify, via command line arguments, options for
each declared database.

Both backends have common command lines options :
- `--db-local:dbname [/path/to/db]`: Use a local database, stored at the specified location in the file-system.
- `--db-remote:dbname host(s)`: Use a remote database accessible at a given remote location.

Note that when you use for the first time the local database options with MongoDb, the Opa
application will download, install, and launch a single instance of MongoDb database.

Note also that you can define database authentication parameters for each
database with the syntax `--db-remote:dbname username:password@hostname:port`.

Database reads/writes
---------------------

One can read from the `/my_db/basic/i` path with:

    x = /my_db/basic/i

and write the contents of said path:

    /my_db/basic/i <- x

Note that the database is structured. Therefore, if you access path `/my_db/basic` you will obtain a value of type `{ int i, float f, string s }`.

Conversely, you could have defined the path `/my_db/basic` as:

    ...
    { int i, float f, string s } /basic
    ...

and then still access paths `/my_db/basic/i`, `/my_db/basic/f` or `/my_db/basic/s` directly.

### Default values

Each path has a _default value_. Whenever you attempt to read a value that does not exist (was never initialized or was removed), the default value is returned.

While Opa can generally define a default value automatically, it is often a good idea to define an application-specific default value:

    ...
    string /basic/s = "default string"
    ...

If you do not define a default value, Opa uses the following strategy:

- the default value for an integer (`int`) is `0`;
- the default value for a floating-point number (`float`) is `0.0`;
- the default value for a `string` is `""`;
- the default value for a record is the record of default values;
- the default value for a sum type is the case which looks most like an empty case (e.g. `{none}` for `option`, `{nil}` for list, etc.)

Updating
--------

Previously we saw how to overwrite a path, like that :

    /path/to/data <- x

which assigns to path `/path/to/data` the value of `x`. This used to be the only
way to write to a path, but since Opa 0.9.0 (S4) there are more ways to update them.

### Int updating

    // Overwrite
    /my_db/basic/i <- 42

    // Increment
    /my_db/basic/i++
    /dbname/i += 10

    // Decrement
    /my_db/basic/i--
    /my_db/basic/i -= 10

    // Sure we can go across records
    /my_db/r/x++

### Record updating

    // Overwrite an entire record
    x = {x: 1, y: 2, v: "Hello, world", lst: []}
    /my_db/r <- x

    // Update a subset of record fields
    /my_db/r <- {x++, y--}

    /my_db/r <- {x++, v : "I just want to update z and incr x"}

### List updating

    // Overwrite an entire list
    /my_db/l <- ["Hello", ",", "world", "."]

    // Removes first element of a list
    /my_db/l pop

    // Removes last element of a list
    /my_db/l shift

    // Append an element
    /my_db/l <+ "element"

    // Append several elements
    /my_db/l <++ ["I", "love", "Opa"]

### Set/Map updating

The values stored inside database sets and maps can be updated as above.
The difference is how we access the elements (more details in the [querying section](/manual/The-database/Querying)).
Furthermore updates can operates on several paths.

    //Increment the field y of the record stored at position 9 of imap
    /dbname/imap[9] <- {y++}

    //Increment fields y of records stored with key smaller than 9
    /dbname/imap[< 9] <- {y++}

    //Increment the field y of record where the field x is equals 9
    /dbname/set[x == 9] <- {y++}

    //Increment the field y of all records where the field x is smaller than 9
    /dbname/set[x < 9] <- {y++}

Querying
--------

Opa 0.9.0 (S4) introduces database sets and a powerful way to access a subset of database collections.

A query is composed from the following operators:
- `==  expr`: equals expr
- `!= expr`: not equals expr
- `<  expr`: lesser than expr
- `<= expr`: lesser than or equals expr
- `>  expr`: greater than expr
- `>= expr`: greater than or equals expr
- `in expr`: "belongs to" `expr`, where `expr` is a list
- `q1 or q2`: satisfy query q1 or q2
- `q1 and q2`: satisfy queries q1 and q2
- `not q`: does not satisfy q
- `{f1 q1, f2 q2, ...}`: the record field `f1` satisfies `q1`,  field `f2` satisfies `q2` etc.

Furthermore you can specify some querying options:
- `skip n`: where `expr` should be an expression of type int, skip the first `n` results
- `limit n`: where `expr` should be an expression of type int, returns a maximum of `n` results
- `order fld (, fld)+`: where fld specify an order. `fld` can be a single identifier or a list of identifiers specifying the fields on which the ordering should be based. Identifiers can optionally be prefixed with `+` or `-` to specify, respectively, ascending or descending order. Finally it's possible to choose the order dynamically with `<ident>=<expr>` where `<expr>` should be of type `{up} or {down}`.

### Querying database sets

    k = {x : 9}
    stored x = /dbname/set[k] // k should be type of set keys, returns a unique value
    stored x = /dbname/set[x == 10] // Returns a unique value because {x} is primary key of set

    dbset(stored, _) x = /dbname/set[y == 10] // Returns a database set because y is not a primary key

    dbset(stored, _) x = /dbname/set[x > 10, y > 0, v in ["foo", "bar"]]

    dbset(stored, _) x = /dbname/set[x > 10, y > 0, v in ["foo", "bar"]; skip 10; limit 15; order +x, -y]

    it = DbSet.iterator(x); // then use Iter module.

### Querying database maps

    // Access to a unique value (like in Opa <0.9.0 (S3))
    stored x = /dbname/imap[9]

    // Access to a submap where keys are lesser than 9 and greater than 4
    intmap(stored) submap = /dbname/imap[< 9 and > 4]

Manipulating paths
------------------

Most operations deal with data, as described above. We will now describe operations
that deal with meta-data, that is the paths themselves.

A path written with notation `!/path/to/data` is called a _value path_. Value
paths represent a snapshot of the data stored at that path. Should you write a new value
at this path at a later stage, this will not affect the data or meta-data of
such snapshots.

    // Getting a value path. i.e. a read only path
    !/path/to/data

Should you need to make reference to the _latest version_ of data and meta-data,
you will need to use a _reference path_, as obtained with the following notation:

    // Getting a reference path. i.e. a r/w path
    @/path/to/data

A path value is specific to its own database backend, indeed the
type of a path contains 2 type variables; the first one for the type of data
stored in the path and the second one for specifying the database backends used for this path.

For instance if `my_db` is declared as a MongoDb database, here is type of its
paths :

    Db.val_path(string, DbMongo.engine) !/my_db/s
    Db.ref_path(string, DbMongo.engine) @/my_db/s

Generic functions to manipulate such values are available in the `Db` module
(imported by default).
There are also more functions specific to different backends:
- `Db3` module from package `stdlib.database.db3` for Db3 backend features, such as path history.
- `DbMongo` from package `stdlib.database.mongo` for MongoDb backend features.

Note, that the same mechanism is used for `dbset('data, 'engine)`

Db3 backend specifics
---------------------

### Restrictions :
- Most of querying/updating are not yet implemented

### Db3 Transactions

Whenever database paths can be accessed simultaneously by many users, consistency
needs to be ensured. For this purpose, Opa offers a mechanism of _transactions_.
Apart from consistency it is also more efficient to explicitly encapsulate a sequence
of database operations occurring in a row within a single transaction.

In their simplest and most common form, transactions take the form of function
`Db.transaction`:

```
function atomic() {
    //...any operations
    void
}

result = Db.transaction(atomic)
match (result) {
 case {none}: //a conflict or another database error prevented the commit
 case ~{some}: //success, [some] contains the result of [atomic()]
}
```

It is possible to get much finer control over what is done with a transaction;
unlike most common database engines, Opa does not force a transaction to be run
in one block: it can be suspended and continued later, without blocking the
database in any way.

```
tr = Transaction.new()

tr.in(atomic)

// some other treatments

match (tr.commit()) {
 case {success}: // ...
 case {failure}: // ...
}
```

Here, only the `atomic` function is run within the transaction, the other
treatments at the top level will be done normally. This means that, until the
transaction `tr` is committed, its results aren't visible from the
outside. Moreover, operations executed in `tr` won't see the changes done
outside, which ensures that it proceeds in a consistent database state. There is
no limit to the number of `tr.in` you can do in the same transaction.

The problem with this approach is that the operations done on both sides could
conflict, and `tr` could stop being valid because of changes written to the
database in the meantime. This is why `commit` can return a `failure`, which
can be used to either try again or inform the user of the error.

// Note: conflict resolution
// At the time being, a transaction will conflict whenever some data that it writes
// has been changed in the meantime. Other conflict policies are planned and, in the future,
// it will be possible to select them on specific database paths (eg. conflict if
// the transaction _read_ some data that has been changed at the time of commit,
// solve conflicts on a counter by adding the increments, etc.)

The continuable transactions are quite useful in a web application context: they
can be used to write operations done by a user synchronously, then only commit
when he chooses to validate. You can get back data from a running transaction
with `tr.try`, by providing an error-case handler:

```
tr = Transaction.new()

some_operations() = some(/* ... */)
error_case() = none

r = tr.try(some_operations, error_case)
```

If you are using multiple databases, the commit of a transaction is guaranteed
to be consistent on all the ones that were accessed in its course (if the commit
fails on a single database, no database will be modified). However, when using
`Transaction.new()`, a low-level transaction is only started on each database as
needed: if you want to make sure your transaction is started at the same point
on different databases, use `Transaction.new_on([database1,database2])` instead.

###Database Schema

Db3 verify that the database stored to the disk is compatible with the
application. If the database schema has changed, Opa will offer the possibility
to perform an automated database migration.

MongoDb backend specifics
-------------------------

Currently, the MongoDb driver does not verify if the compiled application is compatible
with a database schema (the way the Db3 does). That means that after changing
data used in the application the developer herself needs to take care of migrating
the data.
