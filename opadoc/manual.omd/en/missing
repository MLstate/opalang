Hello, XML
----------

The XML family of languages is an important technology for the web, at all
levels.  It structures both web pages, SOAP or WSDL service-oriented application
technologies, but also numerous databases accessible online, e-Book

we will introduce Opa's advanced tools for extracting data from XML or building
