Manpage generation for Opa binaries
-----

.Overview

The manpage of a binary XX is generated according to the rules of
'Makefile'.

0) if a file XX.man exists, we use it

1) if the manpage of XX is generated by a specific Ocaml program, we
use it (e.g. this is the case for the compiler 'opa')

2) otherwise, we try to use existing files:
- XX.summary
- XX.synopsis
- XX.description
- XX.options
and the output of 'XX --help' to build a default manpage.

.Directories

The given Makefile will try to output files in $(BLDDIR)/man/man1
where BLDDIR evals to ../_build (unless otherwise specified).

.How to live with the default manpage generation

Everything should work fine provide 'XX --help' outputs somethings
like this:

XX: do something useful                 ## summary
Usage: XX [options] arguments           ## synopsis
This is some description                ## beginning of description
split
on several lines.                       ## end of description
Options:                                ## introduce the options 
    -o <name>   some useful option
    ...


Existing files .description .summary etc are always higher prioritary
than the chunks of the help message. Missing sections are
omitted. When regexp matching fails, the text ends up as a description
by default.
