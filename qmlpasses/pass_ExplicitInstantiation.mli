   Explicit instantiation adds type abstractions and type applications
   throughout the code to resolve the \@typeof directive

   Only the necessary part of the code is instrumented in this way
   (when you don't use (transitively) \@typeof, your code is not
   rewritten)

   Preconditions: the code is typed

   Directives removed: \@typeof
*)




(** A map of top-level expressions published between client and server. This map
    binds the name of the published function and informations of an
    'ei_skeleton' function. This skeleton throws useless type arguments. These
    informations are the ident of the skeleton and how the skeleton has been
    generated.

    - [`one_lambda e] means the skeleton is composed by a uniq lambda, i.e. the
    type and casual arguments are in the same block. [e] is the size of the
    previous lifted lambda.

    - [`two_lambdas] means the type and casual arguments are in two separated
    blocks

    Where f and g are published:
    {[
      _v0_f = a, b -> \@typeof('b)
      _v0_g = a -> void
    ]}

    Rewrited as:
    {[

      _v0_f = \@lifted_lambda(1, (vvva, a, b -> vvva))
      // _v0_f -> (`one_lambda 0 , _v0 -> f)

      _v0_g = a -> void
      _v1_g = _ -> (a -> void)
