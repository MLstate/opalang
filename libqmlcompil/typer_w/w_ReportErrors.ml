(* ************************************************************************** *)
(** {b Descr}: This function implements detection of cyclic or ill-formed
    types as a post-mortem report. When a cyclic type is detected, we afford
    descending on the whole typechecked expression to see at each node if
    there is a cyclic or ill-formed type. This is a bit costly but that's not a
    big deal since it is used only in case of error. This brings a more precise
    error report than just raising an exception with the type.
    We are forced to make this descent since cyclic or ill-formed types are
    detected after typechecking, during the whole expression or the annotmap's
    types exportation. In the case of the whole expression, we can accurately
    report ... the expression, but when the error arises during annotmap
    exportation, since we "map" on the annotmap, we don't know where the guilty
    type was detected. So, inspecting the expression's types, we can get a
    better, more accurate, location of the error. This saves time for the user
    finding where the guilty type was detected.
    We make 3 local functions for the descent, this way the main, and only
    exported function [report_cyclic_or_ill_formed_type_in_expr] can remind the
    global hosting expression. That's sometimes useful to locate the smallest
    one (i.e. get context around) when we have no line number location like
    with opatop.
