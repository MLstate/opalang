Including external files in an Opa server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The syntax defines two directives for including the contents of one file or the resources of one file:

 - @static_content("foo.png") is replaced by a function that returns the content of compile-time foo.png ; [[syntax_keyword_static_content]]
 - @static_resource("foo.png") is replaced by a resource foo.png -- with the appropriate last modification time, mime type, etc [[syntax_keyword_static_resource]]

Both directives support an additional argument for pre-processing the contents of the file before returning it.

Both directives have a counterpart that, instead of processing and returning one file, process a directory and return it as a stringmap:

 - @static_content_directory("foo/") is replaced by a stringmap from file name to functions that maps key to the equivalent of @static_content(key). Of course, this stringmap is evaluated only once; [[syntax_keyword_static_content_directory]]
 - @static_resource_directory is replaced by a stringmap from file name to functions that maps key to the equivalent of @static_resource(key). Here, too, the stringmap is evaluated only once. [[syntax_keyword_static_resource_directory]]

Again, these directives support an additional argument for pre-processing the contents of the file before returning it.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The two typical scenarios are embedding one resource:

[source,opa]
----------------------------------------------------------------
handler = parser
  | "/favicon.ico"  -> @static_resource("img/favicon.ico")
----------------------------------------------------------------

and embedding many resources:

[source,opa]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
resources = @static_resource_directory("resources")
urls      = parser "/" -> start
          | resource={Server.resource_map(resources)} -> resource

server = Server.simple(urls)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For more details on parsers, see the <<section_syntax_trex, related section>>
For more details on Server.resource_map, see the library documentation.

[NOTE]
Relative paths are understood as starting from the project root.

Resources embedded with these directives support runtime modification for debugging purposes. For more details, see the <<section_runtime_editable_resources, related section>>.


Runtime behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Release mode

Now, chances are that we want to secure these resources, e.g. to ensure that nobody will replace the nice MLstate logo with a not-quite-as-nice competitor logo. For this purpose, it is sufficient to compile your packages in release mode. A resource embedded by a package compiled in release mode is locked safely and can neither be dumped nor reloaded into the application by using --debug-* .
Performance notes

All these directives are fast. Typically, @static_resource or @static_resource_directory will take a few milliseconds at start-up to determine whether they are executed in debug or non-debug mode, and there is no runtime performance loss in non-debug mode. When building resources, prefer these directives to @static_content or @static_content_directory are generally faster, as the final result will be a tad faster with @static_resource_*.

These directives interact nicely with zero-hit cache, provided that developers introduce resources in the zero-hit cache as follows:

[source,opa]
-----------
resources = @static_resource_directory("resources")
urls      = parser "/" -> start
          | resource={Server.permanent_resource_map(resources)} -> resource

server = Server.simple(urls)
-----------

Of course, as usual with the zero-hit cache, you'll have to make sure that you are using URIs. For this purpose, as usual, you should take advantage of Resource.get_uri_of_permanent .
