Hello, web services
-------------------

Nowadays, numerous web applications offer their features as _web services_, APIs
that can be used by other web applications or native clients. This is how
Twitter, GitHub, Google Maps or countless others can be scripted by third-party
applications, using cleanly defined and easily accessible protocols.

With Opa, offering a web service is just as simple as creating any other form of
web application. In this chapter, instead of writing a new application, we will
extend our wiki to make it accessible through such a web API. This task will lead
us through REST web service design, command-line testing of Opa services, management
of URI queries and more.


[TIP]
===========
Several protocols share the landscape of web services, in particular _REST_
(Representational State Transfer, a simple standard which does not specify how
messages should be formated, only how they should be exchanged), _SOAP_ (a more
complex standard imposing conventions on the formatting of messages) and _WSDL_
(a higher-level protocol). In this chapter, we'll only cover _REST_.

===========

Overview
~~~~~~~~

In this chapter, we will modify our wiki to make it accessible by a _REST_
API. This involves few changes from the original wiki, only the addition of a
few cases to differentiate between several kinds of requests that can be sent by
a client -- which does not need to be a browser anymore.

If you are curious, this is the full source code of the REST wiki server:
[source, opa]
-------------
include::hello_wiki_rest_client.opa[]
-------------
[run]#http://wiki_rest_client.tutorials.opalang.org[Run]#

We will now walk through the concepts introduced in this listing.

Removing topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the rest of this chapter (pun intended), we will want to be able to delete a
topic previously added to the wiki. Adding this feature (without showing it in
the user interface) is just the matter of one line, as follows:

[source,opa]
--------------
remove_topic(topic) = Db.remove(@/wiki[topic])
--------------

In this extract, we use function +Db.remove+, a function whose sole role is to
remove the contents of a database path. Notice the +@+ before +/wiki[topic]+?
This symbol signifies that we are not working with the _value_ +/wiki[topic]+ but
with the _path_ itself. If we had omitted this symbol, the Opa compiler would
have complained that +Db.remove+ cannot work with a +string+ -- which is
absolutely true.

Resting a little
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A web service behaves much like a web application, without the client part. In other word, as any Opa
web application, it starts with a +server+:

[source,opa]
.The server, with an entry point for rest
----------------
topic_of_path(path) = String.capitalize(String.to_lower(List.to_string_using("", "", "::", path)))

start =
| {path = [] ... }               -> display("Hello")
| {path = ["_rest_" | path] ...} -> rest(topic_of_path(path))
| {~path ...}                    -> display(topic_of_path(path))

server = Server.of_bundle([@static_include_directory("resources")])
server = Server.simple_dispatch(start)
----------------

In this version of +start+, we have slightly altered our pattern-matching to
handle the case of paths starting with +"\_rest_"+. We decide that such paths
are actually entry points for REST-based requests and handle them as such. Here,
we delegate the management to function +rest+, which we write immediately:


As you may see, this function is also quite simple:
[source,opa]
.Handling rest requests
----------------
rest(topic) =
  match HttpServer.get_method() with
  | {some = {post}} ->
       _ = save_source(topic,
         match HttpServer.get_body() with
         | ~{some} -> some
         |  {none} -> ""
       )
       Resource.raw_status({success})
  | {some = {delete}}->
       do remove_topic(topic)
       Resource.raw_status({success})
  | {some = {get}}   ->
       Resource.raw_response(load_source(topic), "text/plain", {success})
  | _ ->
       Resource.raw_status({method_not_allowed})
----------------

First, notice that +rest+ is based on pattern-matching. Expect to meet pattern-matching
constantly in Opa. The first three patterns are built from some of to the distinct verbs
of the standard vocabulary of REST (these verbs are called _Http methods_):

* +\{post\}+ is used to place information on a server, here to add some content to the wiki;
* +\{delete\}+ is used to remove information from the server, here remove a topic from the wiki;
* +\{get\}+ is used to get information from a server, here to download the source code of an entry.

From these verbs, we build the following patterns:

* +\{some = \{post\}\}+, i.e. the Http method is defined and is _post_;
* +\{some = \{delete\}\}+, i.e. the Http method is defined and is _delete_;
* +\{some = \{get\}\}+, i.e. the Http method is defined and is _get_;
* +_+, i.e. any other case, whether the Http method is not defined or whether it is a method that we do not
wish to handle.

Everything else in +rest+ is simply function calls. You can find the definition of each function in the API
documentation, so we will just introduce quickly the functions you have not seen yet:

* Function +HttpRequest.get_method+ has type +-> option(method)+. If the function is called from a request and
this request has a method _m_, it produces +\{some = m\}+. Otherwise, it produces +\{none\}+.
* Similarly, +HttpRequest.get_body+ has type +-> option(string)+. If the function is called from a request containing
a body _b_, it produces  +\{some = b\}+. Otherwise, it produces +\{none\}+.
* Function +Resource.raw_response+ has type +string, string, status -> resource+. It produces a resource with a body
 from its body, its MIME type, and a status. This function is commonly used to reply to REST requests.
* Finally, function +Resource.raw_status+ has type +status -> resource+. It produces an empty resource, and is generally used to return
 an error to a REST request.

As pattern-matching against an +option+ is very common, Opa provides an operator +?+ that can be used to make
the above extract shorter and more readable.
Expression +a?b+ is equivalent to the following three lines:
[source,opa]
----------------
match a with
  | {none}  -> b
  | ~{some} -> some
----------------

With this expression, we may rewrite our extract as follows:
[source,opa]
.Handling rest requests (shorter variant)
----------------
rest(topic) =
  match HttpServer.get_method() with
  | {some = {post}} ->
       _ = save_source(topic, HttpServer.get_body() ? "")
       Resource.raw_status({success})
  | {some = {delete}}->
       do remove_topic(topic)
       Resource.raw_status({success})
  | {some = {get}}   ->
       Resource.raw_response(load_source(topic), "text/plain", {success})
  | _ ->
       Resource.raw_status({method_not_allowed})
----------------

And with this, we are done! Our wiki can now be scripted by external web applications:

[source,opa]
----------------
include::hello_wiki_rest.opa[]
----------------
[run]#http://wiki_rest.tutorials.opalang.org[Run]#

All in all, the changes required a dozen lines of code.

Exercises will show you how to introduce more complex forms of scripting.

Testing it
~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way of testing a REST API is to use a command-line tool that lets
you place requests directly, for instance +curl+ or +wget+. Assuming
that +curl+ is installed on your system, the following command-line will test
the result of placing a +\{get\}+ request at address +\_rest_/hello+:

---------------
curl localhost:8080/_rest_/hello
---------------

Execute this command-line and +curl+ will show you the result of the call.


Similarly, the following command-line will test the result of placing a +\{post\}+
request at the same address:

---------------
curl localhost:8080/_rest_/hello -d "I've just POSTed to change the contents of my wiki"
---------------

Now, we are not here to learn about +curl+, but to learn about Opa. And what best way to test
the REST API of a wiki than by writing a web front-end that does not rely on its own database
but on that of the wiki we have just defined?

We will do just this in the next chapter.



Questions
~~~~~~~~~
When is a method or a body not defined?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned, functions +HttpServer.get_method+ and +HttpServer.get_body+ can
produce result +\{none\}+ if the http method (respectively the body) does not
exist.

This may be surprising, as, by definition of the protocols, every request has a
method (not all have a body). Indeed, the only case in which +HttpServer.get_method+
returns +\{none\}+ is when there is _no request_, i.e. when the function has been
called by the server for its own use and not during the execution of a request
on behalf of a web browser or a distant web server.

On the other hand, many requests do not have a body. Function +HttpServer.get_body+
returns +\{none\}+ when there is no body, or when there is no request, as above.


Only one +server+?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have started thinking about large applications, at this stage, you might
start worrying about having to centralize all your path management into only one
pattern-matching, which could hurt modularity and hamper your work.

Well, you can stop worrying. With Opa, you may combine any number of servers in
an application. If you look at the API documentation of Opa, you can find
function +Server.make_dispatch+, which is designed to let you write separate
servers for subpaths, subdomains, etc.


Exercises
~~~~~~~~~
Rest for chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add a REST API to your chat, with the following feature:

* use a +\{post\}+ request send a message for immediate display into the chat (for the moment, we will assume that the message has been written by author "ghost").

[TIP]
=========
To deal with several entry points, you will have to rewrite your +server+ and replace +one_page_bundle+ by a dispatcher. For these
exercises, we decide that any request placed on path +\_rest_+ is a REST request.
=========


For testing, use the following command-line (assuming that +curl+ is installed on your system):


--------
curl localhost:8080/_rest_ -d "Whispers..."
--------

Rest for chat, with logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have not done so yet, update your chat to maintain conversation logs in the database.

Now, add the following REST API:

* use a +\{get\}+ request to get the log of messages as +string+ containing one message per line.

Remember, use function +List.to_string_using+ to convert a list to a +string+.

Rest for chat, with queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this exercise, we wish to extend the REST API for the chat to be able to
send a message _and_ give a name to the author of the message. For this purpose,
we need to send more informations than simply +\{post\}+. In the REST world, there
are typically two ways of passing additional informations: either in the URI
itself or in the body of the request. For this exercise, we will see the first
option:

* if a +\{post\}+ request is received on +\_rest_+ and if the _query_ of the request contains a pair +("author", x)+, use the value of +x+ as the author name;
* otherwise, use name "ghost", as above.

[TIP]
.About queries
=========
A _query_ is an element of a URI. From the user's perspective, queries look like
+?author=name&arg2=val2&arg3=val3+. From the developer's perspective, the query
is contained in field +query+ of the URI, just as +path+. This field contains
a list of pairs with the name of the argument and its value. So, for the
previous query, the list will look like:
[source,opa]
---------------
[("author", "name"), ("arg2", "val2"), ("arg3", "val3")]
---------------
Note that the order of these arguments is meaningless.
=========

[TIP]
.About association lists
=========

Lists of pairs containing a name and a value (or, more generally, a key and a
value) are generally called "association lists".

In Opa, the most common function to extract a value from an association list is
+List.assoc+. This function takes two arguments: the key to search and the list in which
to search. Its result is an +option+ which may contain either +\{none\}+ (if the key
does not appear in the list) or +\{some = v\}+ (if the key appears in the list, associated
to value +v+).
=========

Rest for chat, with JSON
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another common technique used among REST services is to pass additional
information as part of the body of the request, often formated using the
JavaScript Object Notation language (or _JSON_). The objective of this exercise
is to use JSON instead of the URI to send the author name to the server.


* if a +\{post\}+ request is received on +\_rest_+ and if the body of the request is a valid JSON construction containing a field +"author"+, use the value associated to this field as the author name;
* otherwise, use name "ghost", as above.

[TIP]
.JSON requests
=========
To obtain the JSON body of a request, use function
+HttpRequest.get_json_body+.
=========

[TIP]
.About JSON
=========
JSON is a format of strings which can be interpreted as simple data structures.
In Opa, a string in JSON format can be transformed into a value with type
+RPC.Json.json+ by using function
[source,opa]
---------------
Json.deserialize: string -> option(RPC.Json.json)
---------------
Note that this function can return +\{none\}+ if the +string+ was incorrectly formated.

The opposite operation is implemented by function
[source,opa]
---------------
Json.serialize: RPC.Json.json -> string
---------------

Type +RPC.Json.json+ is defined as follows:
[source,opa]
---------------
type RPC.Json.json =
    { Int:    int}
  / { Float:  float}
  / { String: string}
  / { Bool:   bool}
  / { List:   list(RPC.Json.json)}
  / { Record: list((string, RPC.Json.json))}
---------------

As above, case +Record+ corresponds to a list of associations.
=========


Hello, web services client
--------------------------

With Opa, accessing a distant web service is as simple as creating one.  In this
chapter, we will develop a variant of our wiki which, instead of using its own
database, will serve as a front-end for the wiki developed in the previous
chapter. This task will lead us through the other side of REST: how to connect
to a distant server, send commands and interpret results. Somewhere along the
way, we will also see how to handle command-line arguments in Opa, how to
analyze text and some interesting features of the language.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

The general idea behind REST is to use the well-known HTTP protocol to
send/receive commands through the web. In other words, a REST client is just a
web application that has a few of the features of a browser, i.e. a web client:
the functions that we will meet in this chapter can be used just as well for
purposes unrelated to REST, for instance to write a web crawler, to post the
contents of a web form automatically, or to download a distant image from an Opa
application.

In this chapter we modify further our wiki to make it use a distant _REST_ API
instead of its own database. As previously, this involves few changes from the
original wiki: we remove the database, we handle error cases in case of
communication issues, and we introduce command-line options to let users specify
where to find the distant REST server.

If you are curious, this is the full source code of the REST wiki client (which also acts as a server):
[source, opa]
-------------
include::hello_wiki_rest_client_customizable.opa[]
-------------
[run]#http://wiki_rest_client.tutorials.opalang.org[Run]#

The web client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to distant servers and services, Opa offers a module called
+WebClient+. The following extract adapts +load_source+ to perform loading from
a distant service:

[source,opa]
---------------
@publish load_source(topic) =
  match WebClient.Get.try_get(uri_for_topic(topic)) with
  | {failure = _} -> "Error, could not connect"
  | {~success} ->
      match WebClient.Result.get_class(success) with
      | {success} -> success.content
      | _         -> "Error {success.code}"
      end
---------------

As in previous variants of the wiki, this version of +load_source+ attempts to
produce the source code matching a topic. The main difference is that, instead
of reading the database, it performs a +\{get\}+ request on a distant
server. This is the role of function +WebClient.Get.try_get+ -- of course,
module +WebClient+ offers similar functions other operations other than
+\{get\}+.  This function takes as argument a URI -- here, provided by a
function +uri_for_topic+ that we will need to write at some point -- and produces
as result a sum type, containing either +\{failure = f\}+ or +\{success = s\}+.

Failures take place when the operation could not proceed at all, for instance
because of network issues, or because the distant server is down. In such case,
+f+ contains more details about the exact error. Any other case means that the
request was successful. Note that, depending on what you are trying to do, the
result of the request could still be something that is no use to your
application. For instance, the server may have returned some content along with
a status of "404 Not Found", to indicate that this content is a default page and
that it actually does not know what to do with your URI. It could be a "100
Continue", to indicate that you should now send more information before it can
proceed. All these responses are _successes_ at the level of +WebClient+,
although many applications decide to treat them as failures.

Here, for our simple protocol, we use function +WebClient.Result.get_class+ to
perform a rough decoding of the server response and categorize it as a success
(case +\{success\}+) or anything else (redirection, client error, server error,
etc.)  (case +_+). In case of success, we return the content of the response,
e.g. +success.content+.

[TIP]
.There's more to distribution than REST
================
Do not forget that this web client is a demonstration of REST. In Opa, REST is
but one of the many ways of handling distribution. Indeed, as long
as your application is written only in Opa, Opa can perform distribution
automatically, using protocols that are largely more efficient for this purpose
than REST.
================

Function +remove_topic+ is even simpler (we ignore the result of the operation):

[source,opa]
---------------
remove_topic(topic) =
   _ = WebClient.Delete.try_delete(uri_for_topic(topic))
   void
---------------

We can similarly adapt +load_rendered+, with a slight change to use the API
we have previously published:

[source,opa]
---------------
@publish load_rendered(topic) =
  source = load_source(topic)
  Markdown.xhtml_of_string(Markdown.default_options, source)
---------------

Finally, we can adapt +save_source+, as follows:

[source,opa]
---------------
@publish save_source(topic, source) =
  match WebClient.Post.try_post(uri_for_topic(topic), source) with
  | { failure = _ } ->
        {failure = "Could not reach the distant server"}
  | { success = s } ->
        match WebClient.Result.get_class(s) with
        |  {success} -> {success = load_rendered(topic)}
        |  _         -> {failure = "Error {s.code}"}
        end
---------------

This version of +save_source+ differs slightly from the original, not only because
it uses a +\{post\}+ request to send the information, but also because it either
returns the result +\{success=...\}+ or indicates an error with +\{failure=...\}+.

We take this opportunity to tweak our UI with a box meant to report such
errors:

Improving error reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We add a +<div>+ called +show_messages+ to the HTML-like user interface,
and we update it in +edit+ and +save+, as follows:

[source,opa]
---------------
display(topic) =
  Resource.styled_page("About {topic}", ["/resources/css.css"],
    <div id=#header><div id=#logo></div>About {topic}</div>
    <div class="show_content" id=#show_content ondblclick={_ -> edit(topic)}>{load_rendered(topic)}</>
    <div class="show_messages" id=#show_messages />
    <textarea class="edit_content" id=#edit_content style="display:none" cols="40" rows="30" onblur={_ -> save(topic)}></>
  )

edit(topic) =
  do Dom.transform([#show_messages <- <></>])
  do Dom.set_value(#edit_content, load_source(topic))
  do Dom.hide(#show_content)
  do Dom.show(#edit_content)
  do Dom.give_focus(#edit_content)
  void

save(topic) =
  match save_source(topic, Dom.get_value(#edit_content)) with
  | { ~success } ->
      do Dom.transform([#show_content <- success]);
      do Dom.hide(#edit_content);
      do Dom.show(#show_content);
      void
  | {~failure} ->
      do Dom.transform([#show_messages <- <>{failure}</>])
      void
---------------

And that is all for the user interface.

Working with URIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have already been using URIs by performing pattern-matching on them inside dispatchers. It is now
time to build new URIs for our function +uri_for_topic+.

[TIP]
.About absolute URIs
===================
Many languages consider that a URI is simply a +string+. In Opa, URIs come in several flavors.
So far, we have been using _absolute uris_, as defined
by the following type:

[source,opa]
---------------
type Uri.absolute =
    { schema:      option(string)
    ; credentials: Uri.uri_credentials
    ; domain:      string
    ; port:        option(int)
    ; path:        list(string)
    ; query:       list((string,string))
    ; fragment:    option(string)
    }

type Uri.uri_credentials =
    { username : option(string)
    ; password : option(string)
    }
---------------

Other flavor exists, e.g. to handle e-mail addresses, relative URIs, etc.

The most general form of URI is +Uri.uri+, whose definition looks like:

[source,opa]
---------------
type Uri.uri = Uri.absolute / Uri.relative / ...
---------------

To cast an +Uri.absolute+ into a +Uri.uri+, use function +Uri.of_absolute+.
To build a +Uri.absolute+, you can either construct a record manually or
_derive_ one from +Uri.default_absolute+.
===================

To match the API we have defined earlier, we need to place requests for +topic+
at URI +http://myserver/\_rest_/topic+. In other words, we may write:

[source,opa]
.uri_of_topic (first version)
--------------
uri_for_topic(topic) =
  Uri.of_absolute({ schema      = {some = "http"}
    credentials = {username = {none} password = {none}}
    domain      = "localhost"  //Assume server is launched locally
    port        = {some = 8080}//Assume server is launched on port 8080
    path        = ["_rest_", topic]
    query       = []
    fragment    = {none}
  })
--------------

It is, however, a tad clumsy to provide +query+, +fragment+, +port+, etc. only
to mention that they are not used. So we will prefer to _derive_ a uri from
+Uri.default_absolute+, as follows:
[source,opa]
.uri_of_topic (with derivation)
--------------
uri_for_topic(topic) =
  Uri.of_absolute({Uri.default_absolute with
     schema = {some = "http"}
     domain = "localhost"
     port   = {some = 8080}
     path   = ["_rest_", topic]
  })
--------------

[TIP]
.Record derivation
================
Use _record derivation_ to construct a record from another one by modifying several fields.
For instance, if we have

[source,opa]
---------------
foo = {a = 1; b = 2}
---------------

we may write

[source,opa]
---------------
bar = {foo with b = 17}
---------------

This is equivalent to the following

[source,opa]
---------------
bar = {a = foo.a; b = 17}
---------------

Using record derivation is a good habit, as it is not only more readable than
copying field values from one record to another, but also faster.
================

With this, your client wiki is complete:

[source,opa]
----------------
include::hello_wiki_rest.opa[]
----------------
[run]#http://wiki_rest.tutorials.opalang.org[Run]#

Launch the server wiki, launch the client wiki on a different port (use option
+-p+ or +--opa-server-port+ to select a port) and behold, you can edit your wiki from two
distinct ports. Or two distinct servers, if you replace +"localhost"+ by the
appropriate server name.

On the other hand, replacing a magic constant by another equally magic constant
is not very nice. Would it not be better to decide that the server name and port
are options that can be configured without recompiling?

Handling options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opa is a higher-order language. Among other things, this means that there are many
ways of defining a function. So far, our function definitions have been quite simple,
but if we wish to define a function whose behavior depends on a command-line option
or on an option somehow defined at start-up, the best and nicest way is to expand
our horizon.

In this case, expanding our horizon starts by rewriting +uri_for_topic+ as follows:
[source,opa]
--------------
uri_for_topic = topic ->
 Uri.of_absolute({Uri.default_absolute with
     schema = {some = "http"}
     domain = "localhost"
     port   = {some = 8080}
     path   = ["_rest_", topic]
  })
--------------

So far, this is absolutely equivalent to what we had written earlier. Note
that we can move the parenthesis as follows:

[source,opa]
--------------
uri_for_topic = (topic ->
 Uri.of_absolute({Uri.default_absolute with
     schema = {some = "http"}
     domain = "localhost"
     port   = {some = 8080}
     path   = ["_rest_", topic]
  })
)
--------------

While we have not changed the behavior of the function at all, this rewrite is a
nice opportunity to split the construction URI in two parts, as follows:

[source,opa]
--------------
uri_for_topic =
(
  base_uri = {Uri.default_absolute with
     schema = {some = "http"}
     domain = "localhost"
     port   = {some = 8080}
  }
  topic -> Uri.of_absolute({base_uri with
     path   = ["_rest_", topic]
  })
)
--------------

Suddenly, things have changed a little: +uri_for_topic+ is still a function that
takes a +topic+ and returns a URI, but with a twist. At some point, when the
function itself is built, it first initializes a (local) value called +base_uri+
which it uses whenever the function is called. This is an example use of
_closures_.

[TIP]
.About closures
==============
You have already met closures in previous chapters. Indeed, most of the event handlers
we have been using so far are closures.

Rigorously, a _closure_ is a function which uses some values that are local but
defined outside of the function itself. Closures are a very powerful mechanism
used in many places in Opa, in particular for event handlers.
==============

With this rewrite, the only task we still have ahead of us is changing +base_uri+
so that it uses options specified on the command-line or in an option file. For
both purposes, Opa offers a module +CommandLine+:

[source,opa]
.+uri_for_topic+ with command-line filter (incomplete)
--------------
uri_for_topic =
(
  default_uri =
    {Uri.default_absolute with
      domain = "localhost"
      schema = {some = "http"}
    }
  base_uri =
    CommandLine.filter({
      title     = "Wiki arguments"
      init      = default_uri
      parsers   = []
      anonymous = []
    })
  topic -> Uri.of_absolute({base_uri with
     path   = ["_rest_", topic]
  })

This variant on +uri_for_topic+ calls +CommandLine.filter+ to instruct the
option system to take into account a family of arguments
to progressively construct +base_uri+, starting from +default_uri+.
We name this family "_Wiki arguments_" and we specify its behavior
with fields +parsers+ (used for named arguments) and +anonymous+
(used for anonymous arguments) which are both empty for the moment.
As long as both fields are empty, this family has no effect
and +base_uri+ is always going to be equal to
+default_uri+ -- we will change this shortly. Also, for the moment,
if you compile your application and launch it with command-line argument
+--help+, you will see an empty entry for a family called "Wiki arguments".

Let us add one command-line option (or, more precisely, a _command-line
parser_) to our family, as follows:

[source,opa]
.Parsing option +--wiki-server-port+
--------------
port_parser =
  {CommandLine.default_parser with
    names       = ["--wiki-server-port"]
    description = "The server port of the REST server for this wiki. By default, 8080."
    on_param(x) = parser y=Rule.natural -> {no_params = {x with port = {some = y}}}
  }
--------------

As you can see, a command-line parser is a record (it has type
+CommandLine.parser+), and here, we derive it from
+CommandLine.default_parser+. In this extract, we only specify the bare
minimum.

Firstly, a command-line parser should have at least one name, here
"--wiki-server-port".

Secondly, Opa needs to know what it should do whenever it encounters something
along the lines of "--wiki-server-port foo" on the command-line. This is the
role of field +on_param+. Argument +x+ is the value we are currently building --
here, initially, +default_uri+. The body of this field is a _text parser_, i.e.
a construction that should analyze a text and either extract information or
reject it. Here, we just want a non-negative integer (aka a "natural number"), a
construction for which the library offers a predefined text parser called
+Rule.natural+.  We call the result +y+.

[TIP]
.About text parsers
==============

Opa offers a powerful text analysis feature with text parsers. Text parsers have roughly
the same role as regular expressions engines found in many web-related languages,
but they are considerably more powerful.

A text parser is introduced with keyword +parser+ and has a syntax roughly comparable
to pattern-matching:
[source,opa]
---------------
  parser y=Rule.natural -> //do something with y
       | y=Rule.hex     -> //do something with y
       | "none"         -> //...
---------------

This parser will accept any non-negative integer and execute the first branch,
or any hexadecimal integer and execute the second branch, or the character
string +"none"+ and execute the third branch. If none of the branches matches
the text, parsing fails.

The core function for applying a text parser to some text is +Parser.try_parse+.
You can find a number of predefined parsing functions in module +Rule+. Additional
modules offer custom parsing, e.g. +Uri.uri_parser+.
==============

The result of +on_param+ must have one of three shapes:

* +\{no_params = v\}+, if the option parser does not expect any additional argument
and is now ready to produce value +v+;
*  +\{params = v\}+, if the option parser expects at least one
other argument;
* +\{opt_params = v\}+, if the option parser can handle additional
arguments but is also satisfied if no such argument is provided.

Here, we expect only one argument after "--wiki-server-port" so we just produce a
value with +\{no_params = ...\}+. As for the result itself, we derive from +x+
the same absolute URI, but with a new content in field +port+.

We can now define in the exact same manner the command-line parser for the host:
[source,opa]
.Parsing option +--wiki-server-domain+
--------------
domain_parser =
  {CommandLine.default_parser with
    names       = ["--wiki-server-domain"]
    description = "The REST server for this wiki. By default, localhost."
    on_param(x) = parser y=Rule.consume -> {no_params = {x with domain = y}}
  }
--------------
The main difference is that we use predefined text parser +Rule.consume+ (which accepts
anything) instead of +Rule.natural+ (which only accepts non-negative integers).

Once we have added both our parsers to +parsers+, we are ready. With a little
additional documentation, we obtain:
[source,opa]
.Command-line arguments (complete)
--------------
uri_for_topic =
  domain_parser =
    {CommandLine.default_parser with
      names       = ["--wiki-server-domain"]
      description = "The REST server for this wiki. By default, localhost."
      on_param(x) = parser y=Rule.consume -> {no_params = {x with domain = y}}
    }
  port_parser =
    {CommandLine.default_parser with
      names       = ["--wiki-server-port"]
      description = "The server port of the REST server for this wiki. By default, 8080."
      on_param(x) = parser y=Rule.natural -> {no_params = {x with port = {some = y}}}
    }
  base_uri =
    CommandLine.filter(
      {title     = "Wiki arguments"
       init      = {Uri.default_absolute with domain = "localhost" schema = {some = "http"}}
       parsers   = [domain_parser, port_parser]
       anonymous = []
      }
    )
  topic -> Uri.of_absolute({base_uri with path = ["_rest_", topic]})
--------------

This completes our REST client. We now have a full-featured REST client that can also act as a server
and supports command-line configuration.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~
Database vs. REST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Modify the wiki so that it acts both as a database-backed wiki and as a REST client:

* by default, behave as the REST client wiki;
* whenever information is downloaded from the REST server, store the information to the local database;
* whenever information is updated locally, store the information to the local database and upload it to the REST server;
* if connection fails for some reason, fallback to the database.

Database vs. REST vs. command-line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Modify the wiki of the previous exercise so that:

* the REST server can be specified from the command-line;
* if no server is specified from the command-line, it behaves exactly as the non-REST wiki;
* otherwise, behave as the wiki of the previous exercise.

[TIP]
.Using tuples
================
For this exercise, you may need to define not just one function using the command-line
but several. In this case, it will probably be interesting to use a _tuple_ definition,
such as

[source,opa]
--------------
(a, b) =
  x = 50
  (x, x+1)
--------------

This tuple definition defines both +a = 50+ and +b = 51+. You can, of course, use
more complex expressions instead of +50+.
================

Architecting a REST chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How would you design a chat distributed among servers using only REST for communications between servers?

[TIP]
.A REST chat?
=========
While it is definitely possible to write a REST-based chat in Opa, this is not the preferred
way of implementing a multi-server application. But it is an interesting exercise, if
only to experience the contrast between manual REST-style distribution and
automated Opa-style distribution.
