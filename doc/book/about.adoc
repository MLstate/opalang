Introducing Opa
---------------

Opa is a new generation of web development platform. It is a new programming
language, a new web server, a new database and a new distributed execution
engine, all of them tightly integrated to provide a great experience for web
developers. And it works in the cloud too!

Throughout the pages of this book, we will introduce you to all the neat
features of Opa, and as you will see, there are many. To quote but a few, Opa is
concise, simple and readable, it is also extremely powerful, concurrent,
dynamically distributed, and secure, much more so than just about any
other web programming language. Opa is designed to make web development fun, secure
and _right_.

What problem does Opa solve?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a great time to be a developer: as a community, we are changing the
world, every day, thanks to the web, to the cloud and their myriads of
applications. And indeed, web applications and the amount of technologies
available to developers have evolved tremendously since the first days of the
web.

Unfortunately, the process of web application development has evolved neither
quite as far nor nearly as fast. Indeed, developing a web application in 2011 is
not so different from developing a PC application in 1991: an impressive amount
of developer time is spent not working on features or improvements but on
_gluing_ together antagonist technologies that were never designed to quite work
together or in this context. In 1991, the technologies were the various hardware
components, the low-level operating system, the high-level operating system and
the memory itself, which could only be hacked into compliance through copious
amounts of machine code. Per se, none of these technologies was wrong, but they
just failed to fit together -- a problem now known as _impedance mismatch_.

Today, the technologies involved include the various incompatible browsers, the
server components or the database components, to quote but a few. As in 1991,
none of these technologies is wrong, but they do not fit together. Because of
this impedence mismatch, developers need to add to their application logic
copious amounts of glue code just to get the components to agree on
communication mechanisms and application-level protocols. Not only is this
glue code tedious, repetitive and error-prone, but this is also where most
safety and security issues arise.

In 1991, the answer to impedence mismatch was Software Development Kits, and
indeed these SDKs proved very useful at allowing developers to develop anything
at all, but failed to address the underlying issues. This was only achieved
later, through better operating systems, better development tools, and resulted
in today's Java Platform, C#, Objective-C or Python, for instance. In 2011, web
frameworks, both client-side and server-side, have the same role as the SDKs of
the 1991s, with the same success but also the same shortcomings.

So, while it is a great time to be a developer, we wanted to make it a better time.

How Opa solves it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Opa, we set out to provide another, better, way of developing web applications
for the cloud. Opa is designed to get you to your finished app faster,
concentrating only on the interesting parts, without the hassle of writing the
glue or of using a programming language against its original design; also
without having to keep such a constant watch on low-level security issues.

Opa is a programming language, but it is a programming language vastly more
powerful than any programming language you have ever used. Opa offers all the
features of a database management system, of a web server, of a server-side
framework, of a client-side framework, of a distribution middleware, a security
audit tool, but without the complexity of deployment, administration, or
impedence mismatch of these technologies.

Developing with Opa is as simple as it gets: first, write your code with the Opa
programming language -- and only the Opa programming language, no JavaScript, no
SQL, or anything such. Then compile the code, and let Opa analyze security,
generate the code for the browser, for the server, for the database, and combine
it with the web server. Finally, launch your executable and your browser, _et
voil&agrave;_. No need to independently deploy, administer or maintain
a database management system, a web server, frameworks or
middleware. And, of course, the application works on any recent browser, whether
mobile or desktop. Oh yes, and it is right away ``Cloud-ready''.

What Opa is not
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Opa offers all the features that developers have come to expect from a
high-end web server, a high-end distributed database management system,
frameworks or distribution engine, Opa does _not_ resemble Apache or Tomcat,
MySQL or Oracle SQL, Drupal or Ruby on Rails, Google AppEngine or Hadoop.

With a little effort, Opa could certainly be used to mimic some of these
components, but that is not how or why Opa was designed. To this day, Opa does
not offer a command-line database interface, or mechanisms to serve web pages
from the file system. Opa is not a patch on top of a programming language, or a
pure engine on top of which a selection of programming languages may be used.

Opa is one technology, consisting of a programming language and its runtime,
designed to carry web developers from start to finish of their development,
from early prototype to seamless deployment.

What is it good for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opa was designed for all users, beginners or seasoned developers, students or
professionals, but not for all applications.

Indeed, Opa was built from the bottom-up for _Cloud_ applications, and shines
most with applications that require scalability, security, interactivity,
real-time web and complex data manipulation.

Think of a social application. Numerous users communicating in real-time by
chat, e-mail, forums or other means, through a rich user interface, but also
through web services that can be accessed by third-party websites or native
mobile interfaces. Perhaps these users can even modify shared appointment tables
or work on some documents together. Developers need to combine complex information sources,
extract the results quickly and get them back to the user in real-time. As the
number of users grows, servers must be added, both to store large amounts of
data, to manipulate it, and to respond quickly to end-users.

Out of the box, Opa features an impressive support for such scalable storage,
heavily concurrent/distributed manipulation of data, service-oriented API and
load-balanced web serving. Even better, as social applications commonly require
considerable computing power, the computing performance of Opa ensures that
fewer machines are required to handle crowds than would be required with other
development solutions.

Or think of an e-Commerce store. Highly dynamic web pages, generated constantly
from the database, and a user experience that may need to be altered quickly and
without disrupting the flow, to match holiday seasons or ongoing ad campaigns,
but also a base of orders that needs to be kept secure from would-be intruders,
and safe from accidents, including hardware failures.

Opa is also great for this kind of applications. Its content management engine
is second to none, whether in flexibility, power or security. Opa's built-in
security checks guarantee that the application will resist most attacks,
while the replicated and versioned database ensures that you can always rollback
to previous data or recover from outages.

We have used Opa to build social networks, e-Commerce applications, but also
multiplayer web games, communication tools, developer-oriented tools -- and
of course http://opalang.org[our website].

A first peek at Opa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rest of the book will introduce you in all details to Opa, but let us take
a sneak peek preview and take a look at the simplest application: Hello, web.

[source, opa]
------------------------
server = one_page_server("Hello", -> <>Hello, web!</>)
------------------------

This is the full source code of the application. Without any setup (besides the
installation of the compiler), obtaining a complete, deployable application is
only a matter of one step:

----------------
opa hello_web.opa
----------------

This command produces a stand-alone executable binary, containing
everything required for execution, including database management, compiled
requests, server code, client code, user interface and everything that may be
needed to connect them or to handle malicious connections or inputs. Opa generated
and checked all this code for you. You may now launch the server:

----------------
./hello_web.exe
----------------

Or, if you prefer, you may deploy it to a cloud:

----------------
opa-cloud hello_web.exe --host localhost --host my@my_server1 --host my@my_server2
----------------

Your application is launched, load-balanced, and servers share whichever information
is necessary.

//Welcome to Opa. It really is that simple.

Summary
~~~~~~~

In the following chapters, we will introduce you to the various features and
use-cases of Opa. Each chapter concentrates on writing one specific application, and
on how best to achieve this using combinations of skills developed in previous and
current chapter. At the end of the book, additional reference chapters recapitulate
in detail all the concepts of the language and the platform.

This book assumes some knowledge of programming (any language should do) and web
pages (knowledge of HTML and CSS will be useful). Any additional knowledge of
web applications will let you understand better how much Opa makes development
_right_.
