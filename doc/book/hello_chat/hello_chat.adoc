Real-time web applications are notoriously difficult to develop. They require a
complex and error-prone infrastructure to handle communications between client
and server, and often from server to server, in addition to deep security checks
against specific attacks that may prove quite subtle.

Opa makes real-time web simple. In this chapter, we will see how to program a
complete web chat application in Opa -- in only 20 lines of code, and without
compromising security. Along the way, we will introduce the basic concepts of
the Opa language, but also user interface manipulation, data structure
manipulation, embedding of external resources, as well as the first building
bricks of concurrency and distribution.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Let us start with a picture of the web chat we will develop in this chapter:

image::hello_chat/result.png[]

This web application offers one chatroom. Users connecting to the web application
with their browser automatically join this chatroom and can immediately
start discussing in real-time. On the picture, we have two users, using regular
web browsers. For the sake of simplicity, in this application, we choose the name
of users randomly.

If you are curious, this is the full source code of the application:

[source, opa]
------------------------
include::hello_chat.opa[]
------------------------
[run]#http://tutorials.opalang.org/hello_chat[Run]#

In this listing, we define the communication infrastructure for the chatroom,
the user interface, and finally, the main application. In the rest of the
chapter, we will walk you through all the concepts and constructions introduced.

Setting up communications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A chat is all about communicating messages between users. This means that we need to decide of what _type_ of messages we wish to transmit,
as follows:

[source,opa]
------------------------
type message = {author: string; text: string}
------------------------

This extract determines that each +message+ is composed of two informations: an +author+ (which is a +string+, in other words, some text)
and a +text+ (also a +string+).

[TIP]
.About types
========================
_Types_ are the shape of data manipulated by an application. Opa uses
types to perform checks on your application, including sanity checks
(e.g. you are not confusing a length and a color) and security checks (e.g. a
malicious user is not attempting to insert a malicious program inside a web page
or to trick the database into confusing informations). Opa also uses types to
perform a number of optimizations.

In most cases, Opa can work even if you do not provide any type information,
thanks to a mechanism of _type inference_. However, in this book, for
documentation purposes, we will put types even in a few places where they are
not needed.

=======================

We say that _type_ +message+ is a _record_ with two _fields_, +author+ and
+text+. We will see in a few minutes how to manipulate a +message+.

At this stage, we have a complete (albeit quite useless) application. Should you
wish to check that your code is correct, you can _compile_ it easily. Save your
code as a file +hello_chat.opa+, open a terminal and enter

.Compiling Hello, Chat
-----------------------
opa hello_chat.opa
-----------------------

Opa will take a few seconds to analyze your application, check that everything
is in order and produce an executable file. We do not really need that file yet,
not until it actually does something. Opa will inform you that you have no
_server_ in your application -- at this stage, your application is not really
useful -- but that is ok, we will add the _server_ shortly.

So far, we have defined +message+. Now, it is time to use it for communications. For
this purpose, we should define a _network_.  Networks are a unit of communication
between browsers or between servers. As you will see, communications are one of
the many domains where Opa shines. To define one, let us write:

[TIP]
.Networks
===============

A network is a real-time web construction used to broadcast messages from one
source to many observers. Networks are used not only for chats, but also for
system event handling or for user interface event handling.

Networks themselves are built upon a unique and extremely powerful paradigm
of _distributed session_, which we will detail in a further chapter.

===============

[source,opa]
------------------------
room = Network.cloud("room"): Network.network(message)
------------------------

This extract defines a _cloud network_ called +room+ and initially empty. As
everything in Opa, this network has a type. The type of this network is
+Network.network(message)+, marking that this is a network used to transmit
informations with type +message+.  We will see later a few other manners of
creating networks for slightly different uses.

And that is it. With these two lines, we have set up our communication
infrastructure -- yes, really. We are now ready to add the user interface.

Defining the user interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define user interfaces, Opa uses a simple HTML-like notation for the
structure, regular CSS for appearance and more Opa code for interactions.
There are also a few higher-level constructions which we will introduce
later, but HTML and CSS are more than sufficient for the following few chapters.

For starters, consider a possible skeleton for the user interface:

.Skeleton of the user interface (incomplete)
[source,opa]
------------------------
<div id=#header><div id=#logo></div></div>
<div id=#conversation></div>
<input id=#entry/>
<div class="button">Send!</div>
------------------------

If you are familiar with HTML, you will recognize easily that this skeleton defines
a few boxes (or +<div>+), called respectively +header+, +logo+ and +conversation+ and
one without a name but with a style class +button+,
as well as a text input zone (or +<input>+) called +entry+. We will use these names to add
interactions and style. If you are not familiar with HTML, it might be a good idea to
grab https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML[a good HTML reference] and check up the tags as you see them.

Actually, for convenience, and because it fits with the rest of the library, we will
put this user interface inside a function, as follows:

.Skeleton of the user interface factorized as a function (still incomplete)
[source,opa]
------------------------
start() =
(
  <div id=#header><div id=#logo></div></div>
  <div id=#conversation></div>
  <input id=#entry/>
  <div class="button">Send!</div>
)
------------------------

This extract defines a _function_ called +start+. This function takes no _argument_
and produces a HTML-like content. As everything in Opa, +start+ has a type. Its
type is +\-> xhtml+ .

[TIP]
.About functions
========================
_Functions_ are bits of the program that represent a treatment that can be
triggered as many times as needed (including zero). Functions that can have
distinct behaviors, take _arguments_ and all functions _produce_ a
_result_. Triggering the treatment is called _calling_ or _invoking_ the
function.

Functions are used pervasively in Opa. A function with type +t1, t2, t3 -> u+
takes 3 arguments, with respective types +t1+, +t2+ and +t3+ and produces
a result with type +u+. A function with type +\-> u+ takes no arguments
and produces a result with type +u+.

There are several ways of defining functions. You can either write +f(x1, x2,
x3) = some_production+ or +f = x1, x2, x3 \-> some_production+, this is
absolutely equivalent. Similarly, for a function with no argument, you can
either write +f() = some_production+ or +f = \-> some_production+.  To call a
function +f+ expecting three arguments, you will need to write +f(arg1, arg2,
arg3)+. Similarly, for a function expecting no argument, you will write +f()+.
=======================

[WARNING]
.Function syntax
========================
In +f(x1, x2, x3) = some_production+, as well as in +f(arg1, arg2, arg3)+, there
is no space between +f+ and +(+.  Adding a space changes the meaning of the
extract and would cause an error during compilation.
=======================


At this stage, we can already go a bit further and invent an author name, as follows:

.Skeleton of the user interface with an arbitrary name (still incomplete)
[source,opa]
------------------------
start() =
(
  author = Random.string(8)
  <div id=#header><div id=#logo></div></div>
  <div id=#conversation></div>
  <input id=#entry/>
  <div class="button">Send!</div>
)
------------------------

This defines a value called +author+, with a name composed of 8 random
characters.

With this, we have placed everything on screen and we have already taken a few
additional steps. That is enough for the user interface for the moment, we should
get started with interactivity.

Sending and receiving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are developing a chat application, so we want the following interactions:

. at start-up, the application should _join_ the room;
. whenever a message is broadcasted to the room, we should display it;
. whenever the user presses return or clicks on the button, a message should be broadcasted to the room.

For these purposes, let us define a few auxiliary functions.

.Broadcasting a message to the room
[source,opa]
------------------------
broadcast(author) =
(
   text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
   message = {author=author text=text}
   do Network.broadcast(message, room)
   Dom.clear_value(#entry)
)
------------------------

This defines a function +broadcast+, with one argument +author+ and performing the following operations:

- read the text entered by the user inside the input called +entry+, call this text +text+;
- create a record with two fields +author+ and +text+, in which the value of field +author+ is +author+ (the argument to the function) and the value field +text+ is +text+ (the value just read from the input), call this record +message+;
- call Opa's network broadcasting function to broadcast +message+ to network +room+;
- clear the contents of the input.

As you can start to see, network-related functions are all prefixed by
+Network.+ and user-interface related functions are all prefixed by +Dom.+. Keep
this in mind, this will come in handy whenever you develop with Opa. Also note
that our record corresponds to type +message+, as defined earlier. Otherwise,
the Opa compiler would complain that there is something suspicious: indeed, we have defined
our network to propagate messages of type +message+, attempting to send a message
that does not fit would be an error.

[TIP]
.About +Dom+
========================
If you are familiar with web applications, you certainly know about the DOM
already. Otherwise, it is sufficient to know that DOM, or Document Object Model,
denotes the manipulation of the contents of a web page once that page is displayed
in the browser.
=======================

Speaking of types, it is generally a good idea to know the type of functions. Function +broadcast+
has type +string \-> void+, meaning that it takes an argument with type +string+ and produces a
value with type +void+. We could have written just as well:

.Broadcasting a message to the room (variant)
[source,opa]
------------------------
broadcast(author: string): void =
(
   text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
   message = {author=author text=text}
   do Network.broadcast(message, room)
   Dom.clear_value(#entry)
)
------------------------

[TIP]
.About +void+
========================
Type +void+ is an alias for the empty record, i.e. the record with no fields.
It is commonly used for functions whose result is meaningless.
=======================

This takes care of sending a message to the network. Let us now define the symmetric function
that we want to be called whenever the network propagates a message:

.Updating the user interface when a message is received
[source,opa]
------------------------
user_update(x: message) =
(
  line = <div class="line">
            <div class="user">{x.author}:</div>
            <div class="message">{x.text}</div>
         </div>
  do Dom.transform([ #conversation +<- line ])
  Dom.scroll_to_bottom(#conversation)
)
------------------------

The role of this function is to display a message just received to the screen.
This function first produces a few items of user interface, using the same
HTML-like syntax as above, and calls these items +line+. It then calls the
+Dom.transform+ function to add the contents of +line+ at the end of box
+conversation+ we have defined earlier. And finally, it scrolls to the bottom of
the box, to ensure that the user can always read the most recent items of the
conversation.

If you look more closely at the HTML-like syntax, you may notice that the contents
inside curly brackets are probably not HTML. Indeed, these curly brackets are
called _inserts_ and they mark the fact that we are inserting not _text_
+"x.author"+, but a text representation of the _value_ of +x.author+, i.e. the
value of field +author+ of record +x+.

[TIP]
.About _inserts_
========================
Opa provides _inserts_ to insert expressions inside HTML, inside strings and in
a few other places that we will introduce as we meet them.

This mechanism of inserts is used both to ensure that the correct information
is displayed and to ensure that this information is sanitized if needs be. It is
powerful, simple and extensible.
=======================

In the extract, we have also seen function +Dom.transform+, whose role is to perform a
(possibly complex) transformation on the screen, here by inserting the contents
of +line+ at the end of +conversation+. Other operators than ++\<-+ can be used
to provide insertion at start, replacement, etc. Actually, this function takes
a _list_ of transformations -- something materialized in the syntax by the square
brackets.

We are now ready to connect interactions.

Connecting interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let us connect +broadcast+ to our button and our input. This changes function +start+ as follows:

.Skeleton of the user interface connected to +broadcast+ (still incomplete)
[source,opa]
------------------------
start() =
(
  author = Random.string(8)
  <div id=#header><div id=#logo></div></div>
  <div id=#conversation></div>
  <input id=#entry onnewline={_ -> broadcast(author)}/>
  <div class="button" onclick={_ -> broadcast(author)}>Send!</div>
)
------------------------

We have just added _event handlers_ to +entry+ and our button. Both call function +broadcast+,
respectively when the user presses _return_ on the text input and when the user clicks on the
button. As you can notice, we find again the curly brackets.

[TIP]
.About _event handlers_
========================
An _event handler_ is a function whose call is triggered not by the application but by the user
herself. Typical event handlers
react to user clicking (the event is called +click+), pressing _return_ (event +newline+),
moving the mouse (event +mousemove+) or the user loading the page (event +ready+).

Event handlers are always connected to HTML-like user interface elements. An event handler
always has type +Dom.event \-> void+.

You can find more informations about event handlers in the Opa API documentation
by searching entry +Dom.event+ .
=======================

We will add one last event handler to our interface, to effectively join the network when
the user loads the page, as follows:

.Skeleton of the user interface now connected to everything (final version)
[source,opa]
------------------------
start() =
(
  author = Random.string(8)
  <div id=#header><div id=#logo></div></div>
  <div id=#conversation onready={_ -> Network.add_callback(user_update, room)}></div>
  <input id=#entry onnewline={_ -> broadcast(author)}/>
  <div class="button" onclick={_ -> broadcast(author)}>Send!</div>
)
------------------------

This event handler is triggered when the page is (fully) loaded and connects function +user_update+
to our network.

And that is it! The user interface is complete and connected to all features. Now, we just need
to add the +server+ and make things a little nicer.

[TIP]
.About +_+
========================
Opa has a special value name +\_+, pronounced "_I don't care_". It is reserved
for values or arguments that you are not
going to use, to avoid clutter. You will frequently see it in event handlers, as it is relatively rare to need
details on the event, at least in this book.
=======================

Bundling, building, launching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every Opa application needs a +server+, to determine what is accessible from the web, so let us define one:

[TIP]
.About servers
=================

In Opa, every web application is defined by one or more server. A server is an
entry point for the web, which offers to users a set of resources, such as web
pages, stylesheets, images, sounds, etc.

=================

.The server (first version)
[source,opa]
------------------------
server = Server.one_page_bundle("Chat", [], [], start)
------------------------

This extract defines a +server+, using +Server.one_page_bundle+, one of the many
server constructors provided by Opa. This specific constructor takes four
arguments:

- the name of the application -- users see it as the title in a browser tab or window;
- a list of additional static files to provide, in particular images or stylesheets -- more on this later, for the moment, an empty list will be sufficient;
- a list of style informations to apply -- more on this later, for the moment, an empty list will be sufficient;
- a function used to initialize and display the user interface -- here, our function +start+.


[TIP]
.About +server+
========================
The value +server+ is special. It does not have to be defined, although an
application without a +server+ is generally not really useful, but if it is
defined it must have type +service+. You can also define more than one +server+
in one application, generally to handle distinct subdomains and/or paths. We will
cover this later.

You can find more information on the definition of a +server+ in the
documentation of the standard library, by searching for +Server+.
=======================

Well, we officially have a complete application. Time to test it!

We have seen compilation already:

.Compiling Hello, Chat
-----------------------
opa hello_chat.opa
-----------------------

Barring any error, Opa will inform you that compilation has succeeded and will produce
a file called +hello_chat.exe+. This file contains everything you need, so you can now
launch it, as follows:

.Running Hello, Chat
-----------------------
./hello_chat.exe
-----------------------

Congratulations, your application is launched. Let us http://localhost:8080[visit it].

[TIP]
.About +hello_chat.exe+
==================

The opa compiler produces self-sufficient executable applications. The
application contains everything is requires, including:

- webpages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript);
- any resource included with +@static_resource_directory+;
- the embedded web server itself;
- the distributed database management system;
- the initial content of the database;
- security checks added automatically by the compiler;
- the distributed communication infrastructure;
- the default configuration for the application;
- whatever is needed to get the various components to communicate.

In other words, to execute an application, you only need to launch this
executable, without having to deploy, configure or otherwise administer
any third-party component.

==================


[TIP]
.About 8080
========================
By default, Opa applications are launched on port 8080. To launch them on a different port,
use command-line argument +--port+. For some ports, you will need administrative rights.
========================

As you can see, it works, but it is not very nice yet:

image::hello_chat/result_without_css.png[]

Perhaps it is time to add some style.

Adding some style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Opa, all styling is done with stylesheets defined in the CSS language. This tutorial is not
about CSS, so if you feel rusty, it is probably a good idea to keep a
https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS[good reference] at hand.

You have two possibilities for adding style information. You can either do it
inside your Opa source file or as an external file. For this example, we will
use an external file with the following contents:

ifndef::basebackend-docbook[]
.Contents of file +resources/css.css+
[source, css]
------------------------
include::resources/css.css[]
------------------------
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
.Contents of file resources/css.css
[source, css]
------------------------
include::resources/css.css[]
------------------------
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

Create a directory called +resources+ and save this file as +resources/css.css+. It might be a good idea to add a few
images to the mix, matching the names given in this stylesheet (+opa-logo.png+, +user.png+, +btn_or.png+) also in directory +resources+.

Now, we will want to instruct our +server+ to access the directory and to use our stylesheet, by rewriting
our +server+ definition as follows:

.The server (final version)
[source,opa]
------------------------
server = Server.one_page_bundle("Chat",
   [@static_resource_directory("resources")], ["resources/css.css"], start)
------------------------

In this extract, we have instructed the Opa _compiler_ to embed the files of directory +resources+,
offer them to the browser, and use our CSS file as the main style for the application.


[TIP]
.About _embedding_
========================
In Opa, the preferred way to handle external files is to _embed_ them in the executable.
This is faster, more secure and easier to deploy than accessing the file system.

To embed a directory, use _directive_ +@static_resource_directory+.
========================

[TIP]
.About _directives_
========================
In Opa, a _directive_ is an instruction given to the compiler. By opposition to _functions_,
which are executed once the application is launched,
directives are executed while the application is being built. Directives always start with character +@+.
========================

While we are adding directives, let us take this opportunity to inform the
compiler it does not have to protect the chatroom from clients, as follows:

[source,opa]
------------------------
@publish room = Network.cloud("room"): Network.network(message)
------------------------

This will considerably improve the speed of the chat.

We are done, by the way. Not only is our application is now complete, it also looks nice:

image::hello_chat/result.png[]

As a summary, let us recapitulate the source file:

.The complete application
[source,opa]
------------------------
include::hello_chat.opa[]
------------------------
[run]#http://tutorials.opalang.org/hello_chat[Run]#

All this in 20 effective lines of code (without the CSS). Note that, in this
final version, we have removed some needless parentheses, which were useful
mostly for explanations, and documented the code.


Questions
~~~~~~~~~
_Where_ is the +room+?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Good question: we have created a network called +room+ and we haven't given any location information, so where exactly
is it? On the server? On some client? In the database?

As +room+ is shared between all users, it is, of course, on the server, but the
best answer is that, generally, you do not need to know. Opa handles such
concerns as deciding what goes to the server or to the client. We will see in a
<<chapter_web, further chapter>> exactly how Opa has extracted this information
from your source code.

Where are my headers?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are accustomed to web applications, you probably wonder about the absence
of headers, to define for instance the title, favicon, stylesheets or html
version. In Opa, all these concerns are handled at higher level. You have
already seen one way of connecting a page to a stylesheet and giving it a
title. As for deciding which html version to use, Opa handles this
behind-the-scenes.

To +do+ or not to +do+?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The source code presented above uses construction +do something+, which may be
mysterious for you at this stage.

There is a very good reason for
this construction: in Opa, every function definition (and more generally every
value not at toplevel) ends with one _value_, which is the result of the
function -- conversely, once we have reached the first _value_, we have
the result of the function, so the function is complete. And, in Opa,
everything is a _value_ except _value definitions_ and _do actions_.

For instance, let us consider the following extract:

[source,opa]
------------------------
broadcast(author) =
(
   text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
   message = {author=author text=text}
   do Network.broadcast(message, room)
   Dom.clear_value(#entry)
)
------------------------

This is the definition of a value called +broadcast+. This value is a function whose production is the following value:
[source,opa]
------------------------
(
   text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
   message = {author=author text=text}
   do Network.broadcast(message, room)
   Dom.clear_value(#entry)
)
------------------------

or, equivalently,

[source,opa]
------------------------
text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
message = {author=author text=text}
do Network.broadcast(message, room)
Dom.clear_value(#entry)
------------------------

This value is composed of two value definitions, one +do+ action and a simpler value, the result of the function.

If we had omitted this +do+, our function definition would have been understood as:

[source,opa]
------------------------
broadcast(author) =
(
   text    = Dom.get_value(#entry)
   message = {author=author text=text}
   Network.broadcast(message, room)   //This is the result

   Dom.clear_value(#entry)            //This is a syntax error
)
------------------------

[TIP]
.+do+ vs. +return+
==================
If you are familiar with languages using the +return+ construction, you can think of +do+
as the _opposite_ of +return+. In Opa, we spend more time returning results than calling
functions without using the result, so this is mirrored in the syntax.
==================

The rule to remember is that you need a +do+ if you are _computing_ a value but you are not _defining_ any value, and it is also not your result.


To +type+ or not to +type+?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned earlier, Opa is designed so that, most of the time, you do not need
to provide type information manually. However, in some cases, if you do not
provide type information, the Opa compiler will raise a _value restriction
error_ and reject the code. Database definitions and value restricted
definitions are the (only) cases in which you need to provide type information
for reasons other than optimization, documentation or stronger checks.

For more information on the theoretical definition of a _value restriction
error_, we invite you to consult the reference chapters of this book. For this
chapter, it is sufficient to say that value restriction is both a safety and a
security measure, that alerts you that there is not enough type information on a
specific value to successfully guard this value against subtle misuses or subtle
attacks. The Opa compiler detects this possible safety or security hole and
rejects the code, until you provide more precise type information.

This only ever happens to toplevel values (i.e. values that are defined outside
of any function), so sometimes, you will need to provide type information for
such values. Since it is also a good documentation practice, this is not a real
loss. If you look at the source code of Opa's standard library, you will notice
that the Opa team strives to always provide such information, although it is
often not necessary, for the sake of documentation.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~
Time to see if this tutorial taught you something! Here are a few exercises that will have you expand and customize
the web chat.

Customizing the display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Customize the chat so that

- the text box appears on top;
- each new message is added at the top, rather than at the bottom.

You will need to use operator +-\<-+ instead of +\+\<-+ to add at start instead of at end.

Saying "hello"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Customize the chat so that, at startup, at the start of +#conversation+, it displays the following message to the current user:
---------
Hello, you are user 8dh335
---------
(replace +8dh335+ by the value of +author+, of course).

- Customize the chat so that, at startup, it displays the following message to all users:
---------
User 8dh335 has joined the room
---------

- Combine both: customize the chat so that the user sees
---------
Hello, you are user 8dh335
---------
and other users see
---------
User 8dh335 has joined the room
---------

[TIP]
.About comparison
========================
To compare two values, use operator +==+ or, equivalently, function +\`==`+ (with the backquotes).
When comparing +x == y+ (or +\`==`(x,y)+), +x+ and +y+ must have the same type. The result of
a comparison is a boolean. We write that the type of function
+`==`+ is +'a,'a \-> bool+.
========================

[TIP]
.About _booleans_
========================
In Opa, booleans are values +{true = void}+ and +{false = void}+, or, more
concisely but equivalently, +\{true\}+ and +\{false\}+.
You can check whether boolean +b+ is true or false by using +if b then ... else ...+ or,
equivalently, +match b with \{true\} -> ... | \{false\} -> ...+.
========================

Distinguishing messages between users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Customize the chat so that your messages are distinguised from messages by other users: your messages should be displayed with one icon and everybody else's messages should be displayed with the default icon.

// - Now, expand this beyond two icons. Of course, each user's icon should remain constant during the conversation.

User customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Let users choose their own user name.
- Let users choose their own icon. You can let them enter a URI, for instance.

[CAUTION]
.More about +xhtml+
========================
For security reasons, values with type +xhtml+ cannot be transmitted from a client to another one.
So you will have to find another way of sending one user's icon to all other users.
========================

Security
^^^^^^^^
As mentioned, values with type +xhtml+ cannot be transmitted from a client to another one. Why?
