The compiler : opa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter describes the _opa_ compiler, which compiles OPA source files to package object files
and links these object files to produce standalone executables.

Level and Modes of utilisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compiler offers 2 levels of utilisation, a high-level one, and a low-level one,
and 2 low-level modes of execution, the compilation and the linking.

Standard utilisation
++++++++++++++++++++

The high-level utilisation of _opa_ is an _autobuild_ mode. It offers an automatic way for building
medium and large applications composed of several packages. It simplifies the set up of a build system.
This is the default behavior of _opa_, able to build an application as a standalone executable,
from all its source files, recompiling only what is needed, without needing e.g. a Makefile.
During the same call to opa, the compiler will process to the compilation of all needed packages,
and perform the final linking at the end.

Same example:
--------------------
user@computer:~/$ ls
foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ opa foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ ls
foo.exe  _build  foo.opa  foo.opx
--------------------

Other modes
+++++++++++

The low-level utilisation of _opa_ is comparable with standard compilers like _gcc_
or _java_. It takes one or more opa files from the same package, compile them into
compiled packages, or link previous compiled packages and opa files, depending on
the activated mode.

Compilation
+++++++++++

This mode corresponds to the compilation of the files composing a package into intermediate object files,
ready to be linked. Note than compiled packages can be shared between linked applications.
For example, the distribution of OPA contains the compiled packages of the stdlib (cf opx files),
and these opx files are linked with all OPA applications.

Linking
+++++++

The linking is the final step in the build process. This produces an standalone executable from
given previously compiled _opx_ files.

[TIP]
.About linking
===========================
It is possible to give some opa file for the linking.
In this case, they are considered to be all regrouped in the same package.
This can be used for a quick prototyping, and small applications, but
this practice is discouraged for medium and big applications. Use rather
autobuild mode (default) or link only packages previously compiled (_opx_)
===========================

Example
+++++++

Example:
--------------------
user@computer:~/$ ls
foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ cat foo.opa
package foo
do print("this is foo.opa\n")

user@computer:~/$ opa -c foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ ls
foo.opa  foo.opx

user@computer:~/$ opa -l foo.opx

user@computer:~/$ ls
a.exe  _build  foo.opa  foo.opx

user@computer:~/$ ./a.exe
this is foo.opa
--------------------

Arguments, input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compiler recognizes a certain number of file extension in its command line.
For more details about the file extension, see the section [Filename extensions]

[width="90%",cols="2",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================
| extension | action
| *.conf | read a conf file for package organisation
| *.cmx, *.cmxa | add ocaml native libraries for linking
| *.opa | compile and/or link opa files
| *.opack | read option and arguments from an external file
| *.opp | link with an OPA plugin
| *.opx | link with a previous compiled package
|========================================================

Output of the compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compiler produces a number of files and/or executable, depending on its mode of utilisation,
and the options activated.

[width="90%",cols="3",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================
| output | mode or option | description
| api | --api | used by _opadoc_
| executable | linking or autobuild | standalone executables
| odep | --odep | dependency graphs of the compiled application
| opx | compilation or autobuild | compiled packages
|========================================================

Options
^^^^^^^

This list contains only the offical options supported in the distributions of OPA.
For more details about your specific opa version, use _opa --help_

Levels and modes of utilisation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[width="90%",cols="3",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================
| option | argument | description
| <default> | none | High-level compilation mode, compiles everything and build a standalone executable
| -c | none | Low-level compilation mode, compiles the current package
| -l | none | Low-level linking mode, link the given packages and opa files
| --autocompile | none | High-level mode, compile every package, but do not link at end, for building e.g. shared opa librairies
|========================================================

// Common errors
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warnings
^^^^^^^^

The warnings of the compiler are organized in hierarchical classes composing a warning tree.
Each warning class is a node of this tree. Each class can contain sub-classes (children), and
can be switched into :

* ignored
* warning
* error

It is possible to change the default properties of a warning class
using the following options:

[width="90%",cols="2",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================
| option | description
| --no-warn | ignored (not printed)
| --warn, --no-warn-error | printed as a warning, the compilation continues
| --warn-error | treated as an error, the compilation stops
|========================================================

For accessing to the list of all warnings, use _--warn-help_.

The name of the classes are implied by their place in the warning tree,
this is the path of nodes leading to the class, lowercased, and separated
by dots. Example, the class _coding_ corresponds to rules about coding style,
and contains a subclass named _deprecated_ used for pointing out the use of deprecated
constructions. So, the name of this subclass for the command line is _coding.deprecated_ :

----------------------------
user@computer:~/$ opa --warn-error coding.deprecated foo.opa
----------------------------

A property set to a class is applied to all children of the class. For example, _--warn-error coding_ implies _--warn-error coding.deprecated_

[TIP]
.About the root warning class
===================================
All warning classes have a common ancestor named _root_, this is the root of the tree.
You can use e.g. _--warn-error root_ for enabling all warnings
as errors. Although this is the root of the tree, the name 'root'
does not appear in each warning class name (this is the only exception)
===================================

Example:

---------------------
user@computer:~/$ ls
foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ cat foo.opa
f(x) = 0

user@computer:~/$ opa foo.opa
Warning unused
File "foo.opa", line 1, characters 2-3, (1:2-1:3 | 2-3)
  Unused variable x.

user@computer:~/$ opa --no-warn unused foo.opa

user@computer:~/$ opa --warn-error unused foo.opa
Warning unused
File "foo.opa", line 1, characters 2-3, (1:2-1:3 | 2-3)
  Unused variable x.

Error
Fatal warning: 'unused'
