  A delay for a specific RPC call.
  A client may be still connected, and continue to ping, but an error occurred
  and this client will never respond to a rpc_call.
  This timeout is meant to abort the rpc_call, and to raise an exception on the server side.
  It is also used as timeout of distant cellules calls.
