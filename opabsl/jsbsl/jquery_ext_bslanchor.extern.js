  This file provides prototypes for function added by side effect to jQuery

  This code is not intended to be compiled and included in any binary, it only
  serves to the Google Closure Compiler checker by giving it prototypes, hence
  avoiding warnings.
  In case the Google Closure Compiler checker is not more used by the build
  system, this source file can be discarded from the Opa sources tree.
  This source file is involved by the build system build_rules.ml for 2 rules:
