exception Syscall (* temporary, could probably be removed for new scheduler *)

(**
   Module to manage asynchronous operations.

*)

(**
   This module provides functions to register
   - asynchronous operations : [listen], [read] and [write] over sockets and file descriptors.
   - asynchronous calculations : [sleep], [timer] and [yield].

   The scheduler is asynchronous and non-preemptive {e i.e.} operations and calculation are registers
   for sometime later in the future and they cannot interrupt one another.
   The general mechanism is to register operations ([read], [write], [listen]) and calculation
   ([sleep], [timer], [yield]) and to call for their execution ([wait]).
*)

(** {6 Types} *)

type t
(** The type of schedulers *)

type connection_info = { (* Temporarily exported for debug *)
  addr    : NetAddr.t; (* the connection type *)
  conn_id : int        (* the unique id of the connection *)
}
(** The type of connections *)

type async_key
(** The type of a key associated to an asynchronous job. See [listen] and [sleep]. *)

(** {6 Exceptions} *)

exception Timeout
  (** Raised when a timeout expires. *)

exception Connection_closed
  (**  Raised when trying to connect through a closed connection. *)

exception Busy_direction
  (**  Raised when another read event is already waiting for data on that connection *)

exception StopTimer
  (** Raised to stop the [timer] *)

exception Empty
  (** Raised when there is nothing queued in the scheduler *)

exception Unbound_key
  (** Raised when an key of type [async_key] is unbound *)

(** {6 Control of the scheduler} *)

val make :  ?is_server:bool -> unit -> t
(** @return a fresh [Scheduler.t]
    @param is_server (optional argument) Setting this parameter to true adds a server startup message. Default: [false]
*)

val default : t
(** A default scheduler *)

val wait : t -> block:bool -> bool
(** [wait sched block] Performs the following action in that order:
    - Executes functions corresponding to operations which reached a deadline.
    - Execute the next pending operation.

    @param block Boolean stating whether the waiting blocks or not
    {e i.e.} if [block] then it waits until any incoming operation,
    otherwise it returns right after the end of execution.

    @return [true] if there still are any pending events or any opened connections, [false] otherwise.
*)

val is_empty : t -> bool
(** @return [true] if and only if there is nothing queued in the scheduler, {e e.g.} no connections
    open and no events or timeouts pending. This method is needed since [wait]
    processes one event and may return [false] whether something was done or
    not. *)

(** {6 Manipulation of connections} *)

val make_connection :  t -> ?register:bool -> NetAddr.t -> connection_info
(** @return a fresh connection.
    @param register States whether the new connection should be registered in the scheduler provided or not. Default: [true]
*)

val remove_connection :
  t -> connection_info -> unit
(**
   Removes the given connection.
*)

val check_connection :
  t -> connection_info -> bool
(**
   @return [true] if the given connection is registered in the given scheduler, [false] otherwise.
*)

val get_connection_addr: connection_info -> NetAddr.t
(**
   @return the address of the given connection.
*)

val get_connection_inet_addr : connection_info -> Unix.inet_addr

val get_connection_fd : connection_info -> Unix.file_descr

val nb_of_connection : t -> int
(**
   @return the number of registered connections in the given scheduler
*)

val get_connection_secured_from_normal : connection_info -> Ssl.socket -> connection_info
(**
   Creates a secured connection from a given connection and a given socket.
*)

(** {6 Asynchronous operation over [connection_info]} *)

(**
   An operation is register in a given scheduler and is set over a connection. It must
   provide a continuation, among other parameters specific to each operation e.g. a string to write.

   A {b continuation} is a function which returns [unit] and which will be executed when
   the corresponding operation is triggered.

   An continuation to handle errors can be provide. If an error happen, this error continuation will be used *instead* of the normal continuation.

   Beside [listen], any operation can be registered with a timeout and/or an error continuation.
   This allows you a fine-grained handling of continuations over time. But {b with great power comes
   great responsabilities}. The policy is the following: if you don't provide any error continuation,
   we'll handle the connection you provided at registration, fine. But if you decide to provide an error
   continuation, you will have to explicitly remove the connection (see [remove_connection] above).
