   This module implement the lib for building and generating all plugins,
   laoder, runtime, etc... from bsl-sources files

(** {6 User Interruption} *)

(**
   Define a public exception for interrupting the lib.
   The command line tool should raise this exception to
   kill properly the lib.
*)
exception SigInt

(**
   Set the sigint signal to this exception.
   Usefull if you want to use this lib from a command line tool.

   Get back to the signal handler before setting SigInt
   Add if needed (not implemented)

val warning_set : WarningClass.Set.t

(** {6 Registering Sessions} *)

(**
   The type of a work in progress register session.
   The type is not functionnal because it contains
   a marshal plugin session which is not functionnal,
   and a private mutable table.

   <!> Beware, the table used is [BslLib.BSL].
   If needed, it is possible to instanciate an other one,
   this is currently not a probleme because the compilers
   uses BSL too, but do not call BslRegisterLib at compile time.
   [bslregister] is done when we compile the plugins, not
   during the compilation of servers.

   Supported extensions are:

   The finalized type, ready to be used for generated file production.

   Finalize the session.

   - all registers
   - js checks
   - opa checks

   JS runtime.
   This is the concatenation of all the js code.

   It is principally used for debugging, and having a trace
   of the resulting code.

   The code is spliten, and is in the plugin file by file.
   Opa compiler use plugins to get back the js code.

   ML loader and plugin.

   This is almost the same file, but the loader contains more than the plugin,
   it contains also dynamic function pointer for passing it to the interpreter,
   so that its key resolution give him back a function which it can apply.

   We use 2 separated files, because since the loader contains functions pointer,
   it depends on the runtime, whereas the compiler does not.
   If the plugin depends also on the runtime, it wont be possible to dynlink
   a plugin from the compiler.

   So, functions are [Obj.t option]
   + in the loader : [Some (Obj.repr myfunction)]
   + in the plugin : [None]

   cf [BslPluginInterface]

   ML Runtime and Runtime header

   This is the concatenation of all the implementation code.
   The mli is generated from the [##register] directives, so
   that in this way we can check that the implementation has
   really the type that the implementer pretend in its register.

   JS keys

   This is a file containing all the key resolution in JS, so that
   we can use the checker for knowing statically if a resolution leads
   to an unbound value.

   Marshal plugin.
   To avoid recompilation and dynamic loading, the infos from a plugin
   can also be marshalled.
   Our applications are supporting both mode, dynlink plugin and marshalled.

   Opa code after pre-processing.
   Directives [##include] and [##include-type] have been solved.
   The code is also in the loader, and plugin.

   Once preprocessed, opa files are regrouped and typed.
   For each opa file, an typed interface can be produced
   somewhere.
