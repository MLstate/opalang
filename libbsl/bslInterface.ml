(**
    The bsl module is a functor which take a module in arg called the {b CTrans}.

    The system of bypass-projections can be resume so :
    + tell the way you represent the opa-values in your compiler by implementing a {b CTrans} module
    + use this CTrans module as an argument of the corresponding functor to build a custom BSLINTROSPECTION module
    + register all primitives you need using this custom BSLINTROSPECTION module
    + use functions of the API to get the generated projected code corresponding to fresh bypasses,
    with the property that they could be applied directly on values of your runtime type algebra.

    For more flexibility, during the projection, you may propagate an environment. (see interface of [CTrans] modules)

    Finally, note that if you don't need to generate code, and you're interressed only by some informations about bypass,
    there is a bsl built by defaut, which is not specialized for any code generator : see module [BSL]
    (the functor is applied with dummy arg-modules).
