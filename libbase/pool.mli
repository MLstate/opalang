(** A pool of element (for short lives element with high allocation cost).
   It diverges to standard allocation (pure GC) when the pool too small.
   Performance gains (vs standard) are not huge (at most 15% on persistant db actors)
   Detection of unused element is based on finalise (i.e. depends on GC),
   which can explain that the gain is small compared to pure GC. (element are not recycled immediatly)
   Can retain unsued memory (pool are originally bounded to 256 Mb per pool).
   By default the pool size is zero (disabled) (set MLSTATE_BUFFER_POOL to activate).
   Element must be heap allocated and must not be an array of float or a record of float.
