(**
   * Simple library, intended to have some of the properties of both
   * String and Buffer.  No automatic resize but it can be done manually.
**)

(** This type is concrete **)
type buf = { mutable str : string; mutable i : int; }

(** Global flag for resize **)
type resize_mode = RM_stdout | RM_stderr | RM_custom of (string -> unit) | RM_failwith | RM_exit | RM_noresize
val auto_resize : resize_mode ref

(** Common to String and Buffer **)
type t = buf
val length : buf -> int
val create : int -> buf
val sub : buf -> int -> int -> string

(** Compatibility with String *)
val make : int -> char -> buf
val get : buf -> int -> char
val unsafe_get : buf -> int -> char
val set : buf -> int -> char -> unit
val unsafe_set : buf -> int -> char -> unit
val copy : buf -> buf

(** Compatibility with Buffer **)
val nth : buf -> int -> char
val clear : buf -> unit
val reset : buf -> unit
val add_char : buf -> char -> unit
val add_string : buf -> string -> unit
val add_substring : buf -> string -> int -> int -> unit
val contents : buf -> string

(** Specifics **)
val empty : unit -> buf
val append : buf -> string -> int -> unit
val add_buf : buf -> buf -> unit
val of_string : string -> buf
val to_string : buf -> string
val resize : buf -> int -> unit
val extend : buf -> int -> unit
val real_length : buf -> int
val spare : buf -> int
