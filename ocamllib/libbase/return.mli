(**
   This module implements a fake 'return' function

   The main reason for using this is when you want to traverse
   a data structure and stop at some point with a value.
   You can use it to defined a find function from an iter function for instance:
   {[ let find predicate =
       set_checkpoint (fun label ->
         iter (fun elt -> if predicate elt then return label (Some elt));
         None
       ) ]}
*)
type 'a label
val set_checkpoint : ('a label -> 'a) -> 'a
val return : 'a label -> 'a -> _
val set_checkpoint_opt : ('a label -> unit) -> 'a option
val set_checkpoint_either : ('returned label -> 'normal) -> ('normal,'returned) Base.either

(**
   If no break are done, return [Some a],
   or else return [None]
*)
val set_checkpoint_none : (unit label -> 'a) -> 'a option
