(**
   Getting line number and pos in line from a global char offset in a file.

*)

(**
   This implementation works with a cache mechanism.
   You should first store files, and then you can perform some call to the API.

   Originally, these functionalities was dispersed and diverging in

   + Trx_runtime
   + QmlLoc
   + OpaParser

   This module is there to group once for all, all functionality related to
   errors reporting from a source file, with line location, and nice colored citations.

   TODO(proposition):
   add a support in the citation part to cache what citation have already be done.
   and a function to reset this cache, to correct the probleme of multiple citation.

(** {6 Alias for common types} *)

(** Just for the lisibility of the interface *)
(** *)
type filename = string
type content = string
type absolute_char_offset = int
type line_number = int
type column_number = int

(** {6 Caching mechanisme} *)

(** [add_file filename content] Add a file to parsed files *)
val add_file : filename -> content -> unit

(** [get_file_content filename] Returns content of the file if is present.
    @raise Not_found if the file in not in the cache table *)
val get_file_content : filename -> content

(** Get (line number, pos in line) from a filename and an absolute position.
    @raise Not_found if the file is not in the cache table *)
val get_pos : filename -> absolute_char_offset -> line_number * column_number

(** Given line and column number produces a string of the shape "line XX, column XX" *)
val get_pos_string : line_number * column_number -> string

(** Get (line number, pos in line) for a given file content.
    WARNING  The content will not be cached, so use only for single requests *)
val get_pos_no_cache : content -> absolute_char_offset -> line_number * column_number

(** Get the offset of the current line. This is the identity if no newline are detected after *)
val get_line : filename -> absolute_char_offset -> absolute_char_offset * line_number

(** Get the offset of the next newline. This is the identity if no newline are detected after *)
val get_next_line : filename -> absolute_char_offset -> absolute_char_offset * line_number

(**
   Get the global begin and end offsets from the line number
   @raise Not_found if no such line, or if the file is not cached
*)

(** {6 Position tracking} *)

(**
   A segment in a file
*)
type range = {
  start : absolute_char_offset ;
  stop : absolute_char_offset ;
}

(**
   Several segments in a file.
   Assert : if you use only the API for building pos (private),
   you can be sure that there is no overlap between ranges
*)
type filerange = {
  filename : filename ;
  ranges : range HdList.t
}

(**
   The type of a position in source code.

   + [Builtin] : No position, inserted by the compiler (precise the pass)
   Any error at [Builtin] is the result of an internal error and should be treated as a failure.
   + [Files] : This come for at least one file, with at least one range.

   The private cache is used for speeding up some redundant requests
*)
type private_cache

type pos = private
  | Builtin of string
  | Files of filerange HdList.t * private_cache

(**
   Build a new pos from nothing. Use to replace the Builtin value,
   you should at least say what pass insert this position.
*)
val nopos : string -> pos

(**
   Get at least one of filenames present in a pos.
   returns ["builtin_pass"] if there are no files
*)
val get_file : pos -> filename

(**
   Get one location of the pos.
   returns ["builtin_pass", 0] if there are no files
*)
val get_one_loc : pos -> filename * line_number

(**
   Get the start of the first filename found in a pos.
   returns [0] if there is no file in the pos
*)
val get_first_char : pos -> absolute_char_offset

(**
   Build a new pos from a filename and a range.
   @raise Invalid argument if stop < start
*)
val make_pos : filename -> absolute_char_offset -> absolute_char_offset -> pos

(**
   In some cases, you do not have the global offset,
   but just the line number. Build a position corresponding
   to the full line.
*)
val make_pos_from_line : filename -> line_number -> pos

(**
   Merge ranges from filenames.
   The positions should contain only exactly one range and merging
   just gives you the position containing the smallest range covering
   them
*)
val merge_pos_for_parser : pos -> pos -> pos

(**
   Merge ranges from filenames.
   If there is at least one filename, there no more Builtin are preserved.
*)
val merge_pos : pos -> pos -> pos
val merge_pos_list : pos list -> pos

(**
   Return [true] only if there is no filename in the pos. (Builtin)
*)
val is_empty : pos -> bool

(**
   Build a string regrouping the location present in the pos.
   The syntax is emacs tuareg-mode frienly.
   There is just one difference, [FilePos] count char index from [0], where
   emacs count from [1] for global chars. For line number, and column, it
   is the same convention.
*)
val to_string : pos -> string

(**
   The same function, with a pp interface.
   @deprecated, use [pp] instead
*)
val pp_pos : Format.formatter -> pos -> unit

(**
   Printer for pos, with a format interface.
*)
val pp : Format.formatter -> pos -> unit

(**
   Print the list of files in a position.
*)
val pp_files : Format.formatter -> pos -> unit


(** {6 Deprecated API} *)

(**
   Used some how by the old qml, will be deleted as soon as we can.
   DO NOT USE IT IN NEW CODE
*)
val to_old_pos_many : pos -> (int*int) StringMap.t
val to_old_pos :  (unit -> string * int * int) -> pos ->  string *int * int


(** {6 Citations} *)

(**
   This is used for printing citation of the source code from a position.
   It is possible to parametrize the citation with some parameters.

   {[
   Citation:

   x =
     y = 5 + "toto"
             ^^^^^^
     z = y * 5
     z + y

   This expression has type string
   but the context expected an expression of type int
   ]}

*)

(**
   Parameters are :
   + [truncate_lines] : by printing the citation, truncate the lines with a length greater than the parameter.
   by default, it is [Some 80]. Principally, it avoid that the message is not visible. The lines containing
   the range to highlight are not truncated.
   + [length_before] : the maximal number of lines to print before the first line contained in the range
   + [length_after] : the maximal number of lines to print after the first line contained in the range
   default is [5]
   + [length_between] : the maximal number of lines to print between to range of the file.
   default is [5]
   + [color] choose the color for highlighting the range. Default is [Some `red].
   + [max_length_citation] eventually truncate the highlighted range if too long. Default is [Some 200].
   It replace the midle part of the range by ["[...]"].
*)
type options = {
  truncate_lines : int option ;

  lines_after : int ;
  lines_between : int ;

  max_length_citation : int option ;
