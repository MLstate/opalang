(**
 *   This module provides 64-bit signed integers. It should be used in place
 * of [int] when this extra bit is required (int's are 63-bit) *and* to make
 * sure everything works on 32-bit platforms (where this type will still provide
 * 64-bits).
 *   In short this should be used in place of int's when dealing with values
 * that may exceed 31 bits.
 *   Performance notice: value of type Int.t will occupy more space and
 * operations on them will generally be slower than over the int type.
