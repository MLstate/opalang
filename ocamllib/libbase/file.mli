     - string = "/profA/profB1/profC2/profD"
     @param path : the path can be absolute or relative.
     @param prefix : optionnal prefix

     If the path is absolute, it is jsut cleaned
     If it is relative, and there is no prefix given, current absolute path is retrieved [Sys.getcwd] and concatenated to path, and then produced path is cleaned
     If it is relative, and a preifx is given, they are jsute concatenated and cleaned
     if path and prefix are relatives, they are concatenated, then current absolute path is concateneted to produced path, and finaly, all is cleaned

   foobar.gogo

   you'll iter on:
