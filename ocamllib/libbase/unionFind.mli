   UnionFind.

   This module offers an imperative implementation for the union find algorithm
   based on linked pointer and collapsing rules.

   A support is given for hooking values to keys.

(** {6 Union Find with key/value } *)

(**
   the type of an element. an element can be seen as a set, or an equivalence class,
   represented by a elt of type 'a. 
   
   <!> values of type [('a, 'b) t] are mutable.

   performing an [union] or [replace] lead to change the returned key/values of a elt.
 *)
type ('a, 'b) t

(** build a new set *)
val make : 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) t

(** merging 2 elts. 
    <!> The key/value resulting in the merged elt is in unspecified.
    @see 'replace' if you need to specify what key/value should be keeped *)
val union : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t -> unit

(**
   this is like an [union] but assure that the [key,value] of the [keeped] element
   are keeped. Essentially, this function is there because in any other implementation,
   the behavior of the function [union] may be unspecified.
*)
val replace : replaced:('a, 'b) t -> keeped:('a, 'b) t -> unit 

(** find pointed key/value by an elt
    @see 'key' for getting only the key
    @see 'value' for getting only the value *)
val find : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a * 'b

(** like [key t] is like [fst (find t)] but slighty optimized 
    @see 'find' for getting key * value *)
val key : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a

(** like [value t] is like [snd (find t)] but slighty optimized
    @see 'find' for getting key * value *)
val value : ('a, 'b) t -> 'b

(** changing the hooked by this class of key *)
val changeval : ('a, 'b) t -> 'b -> unit
