(**
   Functionnal structure for efficient string production.

*)

(**
   This module is for producing big strings in a functionnal way
   with view allocations, e.g. for code generation.

   If you need to have a better complexity for the [concat] operation,
   you can use [SRope] instead, which implement the same interface, but
   with a [concat] in constant time. However, if you need to use the [FBuffer.add]
   function with small strings, [FBuffer] is quicker.

   <!> See the function [diverge], the implementation is not fully functionnal.
   Previous values of [t] are persistent but if you diverge from a point
   of your functionnal historic, you should absolutelly use [diverge] to
   avoid to compromise an other [t] value.

   Note that every function of this Module is tail recursive.

   <!> If you need to add a function to this module, respect this constraint.
   (this module manipulate hudge structures)

(** The abstract type of a FBuffer. Almost Functionnal (see [diverge] function) *)
type t

(** The empty value. The int is just a hint for the first memory allocation.
    The name is ignored and will be removed soon. not used, not implemented,
    weird. (if you create a Stack, do you need to name it ??)
*)
val create : ?name:string -> int -> t

(** {6 Basic operations} *)

(** [add] operations on not too big strings are more effecient
    using [FBuffer] rather than [SRope] *)
val add : t -> string -> t

(** like [add] but add a new line at end *)
val addln : t -> string -> t

(** [concat a b] does not affect [a] or [b] (functional) *)
val concat : t -> t -> t

(** [add_substring t s start len] append to [t] the substring of s
    startgin from [start] from length [len] *)
val add_substring : t -> string -> int -> int -> t

(** diverge is used whenever you need to start from a point of your history
    and to diverge. (implementation is not fully functional, but by using
    this function, you are sure not to erase anything in memory *)
val diverge : t -> t

(** {6 Accessing Contents} *)
(** *)
val contents : t -> string
val output : out_channel -> t -> unit
val length : t -> int
val sub : t -> int -> int -> string

(** {6 Interactive accessors} *)

(**
   Interactive accessors are called with a string [s],
   a start position [p], and a number of characters [n];
   it is supposed to output characters [p] to [p + n - 1] of [s].

   The split in several strings depends on the internal representation.

   If for any reason you need to interactivelly access sub string,
   you can use function [iter_sub] and [fold_sub] applied to
   a function [f] of your choice, which is stricly equivalent
   to
   {[iter (fun s start len -> f (String.sub s start len))]}
   and respectively
   {[fold (fun acc s start len -> f acc (String.sub s start len))]}
   (one more string allocation with [String.sub])

   [rev_iter] and [rev_fold] have better performance than [iter] and [fold].
   They are all tail rec.

val iter : (string -> int -> int -> unit) -> t -> unit
val fold : ('a -> string -> int -> int -> 'a) -> 'a -> t -> 'a

val rev_iter : (string -> int -> int -> unit) -> t -> unit
val rev_fold : ('a -> string -> int -> int -> 'a) -> 'a -> t -> 'a

val iter_sub : (string -> unit) -> t -> unit
val fold_sub : ('a -> string -> 'a) -> 'a -> t -> 'a

(** {6 Format Support} *)

(**
   For outputting a type [t] using format, you can use :
   [Format.printf "%a" FBuffer.fmt t]
   it will be more optimized than
   [Format.printf "%s" (FBuffer.contents t)]
 *)
val fmt : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(**
   [FBuffer.printf t "I add %s" "this"]

   Using the two function combined will give you a quite powerfull
   concatenation possibility :

   if [a], [b], [c] be [3] value of type [FBuffer.t],
   you can do things like :
   [FBuffer.printf t "%a foo %a bar %a" fmt a fmt b fmt c]
*)
val printf : t -> ('params, Format.formatter, unit, t) format4 -> 'params

(**
   Very usefull to replace [Format.sprintf] using a FBuffer implementation.
*)
val sprintf : ('params, Format.formatter, unit, string) format4 -> 'params

(** {6 Dynamic choice of implementation} *)

(**
   You may want to use this structure for having dynamic choice of implementation.
   Modules are not value in caml, this is a defun feature.
