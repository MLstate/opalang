(** This module contains functions and types that are helpful when programming
    in Continuation Passing Style. Included are the Duck-Style-Cps© guidelines,
    for easier and more readable CPS code. *)

(** This type is convenient for more readable cps types:
    for example, [List.map] has type [('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list],
    which in CPS becomes
    [('a -> ('b -> unit) -> unit) -> 'a list -> ('b list -> unit) -> unit]
    Using [Cps.t], one can write it:
    [('a -> 'b Cps.t) -> 'a list -> 'b list Cps.t]
*)
type 'a t = ('a -> unit) -> unit

(** Open this module for duck-style cps-programming©.

    The style is based on two operators, the Duck [@>] for "application of function
    to continuation" ("apply"), and the Pipe [|>] for "application of continuation
    to value" ("return"). It has the nice duality that [f x |> k] and [f x @> k] are
    to equivalent expressions for [f] resp. in non-cps and in cps. This makes style
    consistent even though we always use a mixed cps/non-cps style.

    The convention is as follows:
    - These operators should only be used for continuation application
    - Application of a function to its continuation must be written [@>]
    - Application of a continuation to a value (eg [return]) must be written with [|>]
    - when your code is multiline, always put line breaks just before [@>]. This
      gives a very readable indentation. Put them after [fun ... ->] as well if
      it's not enough.
    - [@>] is associative right, with a priority lower than function
      application, which allows to remove a {b lot} of parentheses. It also allows
      to write chains of operations without indentation: {[
      let f x k =
        cps_function_one x
        @> (fun k y -> cps_function_two y @> k)
        @> (fun k z -> cps_function_three z @> k)
        @> k
      ]}
      which is equivalent to: {[
      let f x =
        let y = noncps_function_one x in
        let z = noncps_function_two y in
        let a = noncps_function_three z in
        a
      ]}

    Remark: a specialised module exists in QmlCpsServerLib for the manipulation of
    run-time continuations (by opposition to ocaml functions).

    Remark: by convention, all CPS functions take their continuation as last
    parameter (except for the inline functions for composition, as in the example
    above). When you write a function that {b actually} works on the continuation
    (eg. does some transformation to it), take it as first parameter, so that there
    is no ambiguity.
