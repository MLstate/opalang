(** {1 General parser for the arguments of servers}

    This must be very generic because it may need to parse arguments related to
    any "appserver component", eg. http server, database server, opa server,
    etc.

    Option parsers are applied with the [filter] function that removes parsed
    args from the current command-line. Hence it is possible to parse several
    times, for different kinds of options.

    {5 Current use}
    Each server-module defines its own options and applies the parser, filtering
    them out and building its [options] record. The opa server, at the end, may
    take whatever is left. When [--help] is present, parsers only print out the
    help {b and continue} for the others to do as well.

    {5 Intended future use}
    Appserver components have no side-effects at loading, but follow an
    interface that requires a speclist (option parser), some appserver options
    and an initialiser ([options -> unit]) to be defined. We define a
    component-combiner functor, and the Appserver is a functor that takes a
    component as argument.

    This way, all speclists are merged (and checked for conflicts), and we parse
    arguments in one pass, fill each individual options structure, and call the
    init function of each component. Then a main-server-loop may be run.

    {5 More remarks and todos}
    For opa servers, they would need a specific construction (pass?) to register
    options, if we don't want database opening to be necessary to print the (end
    of the) help message.

    Last option parsing should also be a special case: it needs to check for any
    remaining options and warn about the errors, as well as quit in the case
    '--help' was present.

    In the "intended future use", the [Appserver.start] could to both these
    tasks. (It would probably take place before any opa code is executed).

val fold_all : ('a -> 'a param_parser) -> 'a -> 'a param_parser
  (**
     Repeat the application of a parser until the end of args, accumulating the results.
     When the parser does not apply, arguments are skipped, and previous result of
     accumulation is passed to the next arguments.
     This is used for parsing e.g. anonymous arguments
  *)

val skip_str: string -> 'a param_parser -> 'a option param_parser

      typically "--". *)

      another option in a module B that loads later. *)

type 'a arg_parser = string list * ('a -> 'a param_parser) * string * string
    (** [(names,effect,params_doc,doc)] tuple:
        - [names] are the option name and variants (guideline: long name first
        starting with "--", optionally followed by shortcut (one char)
        starting with "-")
        - the effect will be called on the following arguments when the name matched
        - [params_doc] should be the empty string if the option has no
        additional parameters, [<type>] for mandatory parameters, [[type]] for
        optional parameters.
        - [doc] is the description of the option. Guideline: first letter
        capitalised, no dot at the end.

        For example:
        {[
        (["--opa"], func string (fun opts file -> { opts with opa = file }),
        "<string>", "Specify an OPA source file")
        ]}
        is the specification of the [--opa] option that takes one mandatory
        argument of type string.

        Note: you should not do side-effects inside the parser (they may be
        executed even if a "--help" is read later). *)

  (** Makes a param_parser from a list of arg_parsers. The '-help' and '--help'
      options have a default handler that turns off handling of other options,
      prints the help string with Logger.log_error and return the structure
      unchanged.
      The first argument is the title of the parser, printed in the help (no
      capital letters, no punctuation).

      You are allowed to have arguments toggled by ppdebug vars in your
      arg_parser list, but don't forget to add [debug] at the start of the
      description string in that case, to avoid confusion.

      later parsing. Extraction stops if "--" is met ; the argument after
