Hello ;) 

If you're here, you probably want to add some bypass primitiv with new implementation files to the BSL.
To do it, you can simply add your file here in the appropriate directory, check that it contains register directives, 
and add its name to the file bsl-sources in the same directory.

If there is an ml implementation, your primitives will be loaded in the qmltop-level.
After reinstalling the libbsl upgraded with your new lib,
you can check that your new modules or functions are available by using the libbsl introspection tool : bslbrowser

Enjoy,
M & M
