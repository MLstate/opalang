== Widget FloatValue ==

Display and edit a float, possibly with an interval constraint or an arbitrary validation function.

Should provide three functions: +show+, +edit+ and +html+.
The function +html+ will be deduced from +interactions/editable+

In edit mode, the float should be editable with the keyboard. The show mode is trivial (no buttons).

In a second version of the widget, the edition will (optionnally) include buttons +#+#+ and +#-#+ right to the float. The step caused by pressing a button must be configurable.

This widget should provide a default implementation of +CTable.Cell.widget(float)+.
