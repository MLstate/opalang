== Widget IntValue ==

Display and edit an integer, possibly with an interval constraint or an arbitrary validation function.

Should provide three functions: +show+, +edit+ and +html+.
The function +html+ will be deduced from +interactions/editable+

In edit mode, the integer should be editable with the keyboard or by pressing buttons +#+#+ and +#-#+ right to the integer. The show mode is trivial (no buttons).

This widget should provide a default implementation of +CTable.Cell.widget(int)+.
