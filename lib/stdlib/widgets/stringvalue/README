== Widget StringValue ==

Display and edit a one-line string, possibly with an arbitrary validation function.

Should provide three functions: +show+, +edit+ and +html+.
The function +html+ will be deduced from +interactions/editable+

This widget should provide a default implementation of +CTable.Cell.widget(string)+.
