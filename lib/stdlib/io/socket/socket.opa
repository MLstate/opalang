/**
    {1 About this module}

    ``Low-level'' network module.

    This module helps you to do some low-level networking. You can
    connect to a server, and write and read raw data to/from it.

    The err_cont functions are exactly the same as the non-err_cont
    functions except you get an outcome of either the success result or
    a failure with the exception turned into a string.  Timeouts are
    ints as milliseconds.

    The binary_ functions are intended to work directly with the
    binary type but note that a socket opened in binary_mode should
    only be read/written with the binary functions.  Reading or
    writing the other type will result in the data being copied.

    The Mailbox module is intended to allow reading of data in multiple
    calls.  See [read_fixed] for an example of its use.

    {b Warning:} This module is still experimental.
