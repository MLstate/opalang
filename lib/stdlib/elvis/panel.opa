/**
 * {1 Panels}
 *
 * Panels have multiple uses:
 * - they serve as containers for several elvises
 * - they serve as cut-off points for changing theme, e.g. the theme outside a panel can be different from the theme inside the panel
 * - they can be given classes that can be referenced from CSS, e.g. to allow sizing
 * - children elvises are automatically given classes, e.g. to allow positioning
 */

/**
 * {1 Theming}
 *
 * The panel always has classes "mlstate", "elvis", "panel", plus any classes implied by the theme or by the options.
 * The children of the panel have the same theme as the panel itself, which is either the theme provided as option, or otherwise the parent theme.
 * Each child is embedded in a container numbered [panel_child_0], [panel_child_1], etc.
