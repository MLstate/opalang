/**
 * Arguments for tagging part of the code as deprecated.

/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module defines the type of the argument of the directive @deprecated
 *
 * These arguments are read at compile time, and should use literal only.
 * @see pass_CodingDirectives
 * @see opa parser
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * Here are some example of use:
 *
 * A deprecation directive that specifies the version of the code when
 * the function became deprecated and suggests another one to be used
 * instead:
 *
 * {[
 *   @deprecated({use="bar", version=some("1.2.3")}) foo = bar
 * }
 *
 * A deprecation directive that does not specify the version and
 * provides a textual hint about the deprecated code:
 *
 * {[
 *   @deprecated({hint="Please refactor your code, this function does no longer exists", version=none}) foo = ...
 * }
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
