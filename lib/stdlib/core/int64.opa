/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * The Int64 module was previously just a placeholder for anonymous external data providing
 * a means for retaining pure 64-bit values hidden behind the Bsl.
 *
 * This is now a minimal-implementation of an int64 type which provides 64-bit integer
 * arithmetic and bitwise operations.
 *
 * Note, however, that there is a disparity between the OCaml and Node.js backends, OCaml 64-bit
 * integers are signed, whereas the Node.js implementation is unsigned.  This will be fixed at some
 * future development.
 *
 * Note also that the Node.js representation is as two 32-bit integers (each of which is actually
 * stored as 64-bit values) and arithmetic operations are likely to be very slow.  This module is
 * not intended to support significant computations on 64-bit ints.  Due to the underlying float
 * model for Node.js integers, int64 values in Node.js can actually be NaN.
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * The operations in here are very self-explanatory.
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * It is unlikely that this module will ever be developed any further other than to make
 * Node.js int64 values signed.
