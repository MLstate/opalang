 *
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module contains functions to manipulate durations, i.e. intervals
 * of time. Duration can be either positive (duration "in the future") or
 * negative (duration "in the past").
 *
 * You may also be interested in the module {!Date} which contains functions
 * to manipulate dates & times.
 *
 *
 * {1 When to use this module}
 *
 * This module will let you manipulate durations. You will probably need
 * it when you need to compute date intervals (i.e. the time span between
 * two dates). It will also allow you to print them in a format of your
 * choice (such as: "yesterday", "tomorrow", "in 2 days", "3 hours ago"
 * etc.)
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}

  /**
   *   This function takes a format for printing durations and generates a
   * "duration printer", which can later be used with the {!print}
   * function. Below we describe how the format string should look like.
   *
   *   The format describes how a time duration should be* converted to a
   * string representation. Before the conversion a duration is rounded to
   * the nearest second (i.e. milliseconds are ignored).
   *
   *   Conversion takes place in the context of two variables:
   * - "VAL" (represented by #) and
   * - "DUR"
   *   At the beginning of the conversion "VAL" is undefined and "DUR" corresponds
   * to the duration being converted. Those values will be alerted by the directives
   * contained in the format string described hereafter.
   *
   *   The following directives operate on the "DUR" variable and convert it to
   * the numerical value corresponding to the maximal number of given units contained
   * in the duration. Read the following entries as: "number of complete ... in the
   * duration".
   * - [%x] milliseconds
   * - [%s] seconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds)
   * - [%m] minutes (1 minute = 60 seconds)
   * - [%h] hours (1 hour = 60 minutes)
   * - [%D] days (1 day = 24 hours)
   * - [%W] weeks (1 week = 7 days)
   * - [%M] months (1 month = 365/12 days)
   * - [%Y] years (1 year = 365 days)
   *
   *   Besides the following modes are available:
   * - "%X" just prints the numerical value corresponding to the duration, as
   *     described above.
   * - "#" prints the value "VAL"
   * - "[%X:...]" prints the nested format "..." with the "VAL" variable
   *     set to the maximal number of "X" units in the actual duration "DUR"
   *     and the "DUR" duration decreased by that amount.
   *     Let's for instance consider the duration of 1000 days and the format:
   *       "[%y:# years and %d days]"
   *     The printer will compute the number of complete years, 2 in this case,
   *     and will evaluate the nested format with duration decreased by 2 full
   *     years, i.e. with 1000 - 2*365 = 270 days, so the resulting conversion
   *     will be:
   *      "2 years and 270 days"
   *     This mode can be nested.
   * - "[#YN:...]" where:
   *      Y = '>', '=' or '<' and
   *      N is a natural number
   *    This mode prints the nested format "..." only if the current value "VAL" is:
   *    greater than, equal or less than (resp. for Y='>', Y='=' and Y='<') the
   *    number 'N'.
   *    Typical use of this mode will be with N=0 or N=1 to check, respectively,
   *    whether given units should be printed / units should be printed in singular
   *    or plural. But higher values can also be useful, for instance to suppress
   *    printing the concrete value and replace it with 'many' or similar.
   * - "[#YN:...:...]"
   *    A variant of the above mode where the format after the first colon if
   *    printer if the condition is true and the format after the second if it
   *    is not.
   * - "[%Y:...] where:
   *      Y = '>', '0' or '<' and
   *    This mode prints the nested format "..." only if the current duration "DUR"
   *    is: positive, instantaneous, negative (resp. for Y='>', Y='0' and Y='<').
   *    Typical use of this mode will be to print some prefix/suffix (such as:
   *    ('*in* ... days' or '... days *ago*'
   *
   *   Besides the above sequences and modes, the rest of the format is interpreted
   * verbatim as a string. Special characters: [%], [#], [[] and []] need escaping
   * with "\".
   *
   * Example 1)
   * ==========
   *   Let's say we want to print a duration in the format:
   * "[in] X  years Y months Z days [ago]"
   *   but:
   * - omitting given entry if the corresponding value is zero,
   * - printing the prefix "in"/suffix "ago" depending on whether the duration is
   *   positive/negative.
   * - replacing those 3 fields with "less than one day" if absolute value duration
   *   of the duration is less than a day.
   *
   *   For instance for a positive duration of 1000 days we want to get:
   *   "in 2 years 8 months 22 days"
   *   and for the negative duration of 12 hours we want to get:
   *   "less than a day ago"
   *
   *   The format that would accomplish that is:
   *   "[%>:in ][%D:[#0:less than a day ]][%Y:[#>:# years ][%M:[#>:# months ][%D:[#>:# days ]]]][%<:ago]"
   *
   * @param format a format for printing durations.
   * @param an optional duration printer, or else an indication of an error in the
   *        duration format.
