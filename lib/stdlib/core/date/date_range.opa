 * {1 About this module}
 *
 *   This module contains functions to manipulate date ranges. A date range
 * is a time interval fixed in time; in other words a date range consist
 * of a starting and ending date.
 *
 *   If you are interested in time durations (intervals), without a fixed
 * location in time then see the {!Duration} module.
 *
 *
 * {1 When to use this module}
 *
 *   This module will let you manipulate date ranges, which occur naturally
 * when considering time events (think: events in your agenda).
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
