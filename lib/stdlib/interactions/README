.Summary
This graphic library allows one to easily build editable, draggable, droppable and resizable areas out of pre-existing pieces of (dynamic) html.

.Editable
Builds a two state show/edit input field with an intuitive behaviour (requires the corresponding two pieces of html as input)

See the editable title at http://www.netvibes.com/privatepage/1#General for the desired behaviour and management of h-over.

.Draggable
Encapsulate a piece of html so that it becomes draggable, that is, movable using the mouse. the finger in iPads and iPhones.

.Droppable
Encapsulate a piece of html so that it becomes a possible target for dropping draggable objects.

.Resizable
Encapsulate a piece of html so that it becomes resizable.
Will add a handle (overlay) on the bottom-right-hand corner.

.Biblio
See JQuery.UI for examples of draggable, droppable and resizable areas.
