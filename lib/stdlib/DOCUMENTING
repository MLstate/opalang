/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module contains a high-level interface for boiling water and preparing tea.
 * If you wish to prepare tea, this is probably the module you are looking for.
 *
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * If you simply want to prepare some tea, use function [Tea.prepare].
 *
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * Some teas need careful preparations, e.g. Black Tea should be prepared with hot
 * water, just boiled, at 95 Celcius, and should infuse for 3 minutes. Other teas
 * require the water to be at 80 Celcius or to infuse for 5 minutes. If you need fine
 * control on the temperature of water and infusion, you can obtain more control on
 * tea preparation by using more powerful functions [Tea.boil], [Tea.infuse] and
 * [Tea.serve].
 *
 * Sometimes, you may also need to validate the leaves you have, e.g. to check whether
 * they are real tea or some substitute such as herbal tea or roibos. For this purpose,
 * use [Tea.get_variety].
 *
 * If this is not sufficient, you may need to use lower-level module [Drinks].
