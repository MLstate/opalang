== Calendar component ==

.Monthly view:
- Make calendar unselectable. That would require OPA to accept the following CSS:
--------------------
*.unselectable {
   -moz-user-select: -moz-none;
   -khtml-user-select: none;
   -webkit-user-select: none;
   user-select: none;
}
--------------------
- For today display also the time (updated); this will require making widgets.dateprinter more generic.
- Better integration with datepicker for "goto" button (add styling, ...)

.Daily view:
.Weekly view:
.Two weeks view:
