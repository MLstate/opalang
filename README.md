# Opa #

Opa is an advanced framework for JavaScript, made of two parts:

* A compiler from the Opa language, which features JavaScript-like syntax but introduces many enhancements;
* A JavaScript library, which is used at runtime.

This repository contains all the sources of both the Opa compiler and the Opa library.

## License ##

Opa is open source. The compiler is released under the AGPL license, the library under the MIT license. 

Applications written with Opa only include the library part, so you are **free to release applications written with Opa under any proprietary or open source license**.

If you want to create an online "cloud" application platform that includes the Opa compiler, you need to release the sources under the AGPL license as per the AGPL license terms.

Read both [licenses](https://github.com/MLstate/opalang/tree/master/doc).
