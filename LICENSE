The repository opalang is currently versioning 2 external tools in tools/
used only during the build process of Opa :
* The Closure Compiler (see tools/jschecker/README for copyright information)
* JsDoc Toolkit (see tools/jsdoc-toolkit/README.txt for copyright information)

The Closure Compiler is used as a checker for the JavaScript part of the sources
of Opa, and JsDoc Toolkit is used for generating HTML documentation pages from this
JavaScript code.

The use of these tools is transitional, and will soon be made optional.

Part of the jslang library, has been closely inspired by ocamljs/jslib:
* ocamljs/jslib, Â© 2007-2009 2007-9 Skydeck, Inc, distributed under LGPL v2
In particular files compiler/jslang/jsAst.ml and compiler/jslang/jsPrint.ml are extended versions of the modules found in ocamljs, specialized for Opa specific needs.
We would like to thank the authors of the ocamljs/jslib.

Opa also includes external libraries :
* Bootstrap, from Twitter - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
* Font Awesome - http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome
* Meteor Spark - https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Spark
