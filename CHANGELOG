New supported platform:

  * FreeBSD
    - Opa commited to FreeBSD port trees: http://www.freshports.org/lang/opa/
      Thanks to Jeremy Messenger <mezz.freebsd@gmail.com>

New features:

  * Doc: 3 first chapters translated in Chinese.
    Thanks to Li Wenbo <li.wenbo@whu.edu.cn> for this major contribution!
    Online preview: http://cn.doc.opalang.org

  * Syntax:
    - Possibility to use underscore inside numbers
    - In js-like syntax, block braces of inserts can be used as delimiting a anonymous block function.
      e.g.            <div> onready={ {function(_) code} }></>
      and             <div> onready={ function(_){ code} }></>
      can be written  <div> onready={ function(_) code   }></>

  * Parser.alphanum, Parser.ident and Parser.bool added

  * Scheduler
    - New functions for advance users, providing fine-tuning of scheduling policy:
      set_max_compute_successive, new set_nb_step_apply, point, yield, switch.

  * IMAP Client

  * SMTP Client
    - plain authentication

  * HTTP Server
    - PUT and DELETE methods are now handled

  * Iconv
    - binded libiconv with the help of iconv-ocaml
    - added an Iconv module consequently

  * The directive @atomic(expr) now checks that the compiler is able to emit an atomic expression computation
    (i.e. containing no scheduling point)

  * Queue: add many folding function

  * Set: add 'mapping' functions that can map to different kind of set

  * List: add 'rev_iter'

  * Random: add 'bool'

     - and reference with exclusive access

Improvements:

  * Easier to define several server register: it now accepts a single registrable or a list of registrable

  * Better support of html5 void elements: for those elements, the close tag is now optional
    Note: html5 void elements can't be closed with a frag tag (</>).

  * Easier to change the doctype. For example, to use html5 doctype:
    Server.start(Server.http, [{register: { doctype : { html5 }}}, {title:"html5", ~page} ])

  * utf-8 charset meta tag automatically added for doctype html5

  * namespace on html tag only for doctype xhtml1_1

  * Resource:
    - allow custom response headers (name, value)

  * SMTP Client
    - return the raw message sent on success (Ok)

  * Cache
    - removed deprecated Negociator API (misspelled)
    - added reset function to reset cache entirely

  * Mime
    - Mime.get_text now takes an additional decoding function
    - Mime.Header.decode_value also takes a decoding function

  * Bootstrap
    - upgraded to Bootstrap 2.0.3
    - ability to import Bootstrap CSS with or without responsiveness
    - merged WBootstrap Badge and Label importance type
