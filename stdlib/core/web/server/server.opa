/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module provides the necessary functions to define web servers / web services.
 *
 * {1 Where do I start?}
 *
 * It depends on the kind of application you intend to write. If your application fits
 * on one page, you should use the simplest server available, use [one_page_server]. This
 * server is well-suited to applications that behave like desktop applications rather
 * than web pages, e.g. Google Mail.
 *
 * If, on the other hand, you wish your application to manipulate several pages, you
 * should use [simple_server]. This server is well-suited to applications that are
 * spread among  several distinct pages, with links, images, etc. For instance, blogs.
 * Primitives for manipulating pages, images, etc. can be find in module [Resources].
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
 *
 * For advanced uses, a third and more powerful server is available, [Server.make].
 * In addition to the features of [simple_server], [Server.make] will let you access
 * information about the connexion. This function may be composed with the functions
 * of module [UserContext] and with function [Resource.in_context] to attach information
 * to each user, such as log-in credentials, user-specific data, etc.
 *
 * Finally, if your server needs secure communications, you should use function [Server.secure].
 * As [Server.make], this function will let you access and store information about users. In
 * addition, this function enforces https-encrypted communications and guarantees that all the
 * resources provided by the server are protected by some resource access policy. Of course, you
 * will need to define and provide a policy, for instance the one implemented in the [Login] module.
 *
 * Note that https-encrypted communications require an OpenSSL certificate, which you need to obtain
 * from certification authorities.
