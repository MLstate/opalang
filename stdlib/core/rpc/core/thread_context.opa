/**
 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * At any position in the code, the execution must know on behalf of which user it
 * is taking place. On the client, we consider that, trivially, this is on behalf of the
 * current client. On the server, we consider that this can be either on behalf of the
 * user who initiated the request which, up-to session calls and thread management,
 * lead to this position in the code, or on behalf of the server itself (e.g. if the server
 * performs regular clean-up or is still initializing).
 *
 * From the point of view of the developer, thread-local context can be accessed
 * by a primitive thread_context, which returns a record of type [ThreadContext.t]
 *
 * On the client, all fields are defined at initialization time and are imple-
 * mented as global variables. On the server, all fields are defined when a request
 * starts and propagated through the code as part of the CPS context and as part of
 * session-specific calls.
 *
 * The casual user should not use directives @thread_context/@with_thread_context himself
 * @with_thread_context is inserted in the url dispatcher, while thread_context is used by the user.
 * The directive @thread_context returns an option, and the primitive provide a default value.
