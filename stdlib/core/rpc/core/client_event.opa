  * This file provides the primitives to bind client events to callbacks.

  * disconnections in order to free data-structures related to dead clients

  * The usage principle is, when resources are allocated, a callbac must be
  * registered frying these resources. Once the client dies, these disallocation
  * callbacks get called automatically (after around 1 minute).
