 * {1 About this module}
 *
 * This module contains functions to manipulate dates and times.
 * If instead you are interested in time durations (intervals) or date
 * ranges (durations fixed in time), see, respectively, the {!Duration}
 * and {!DateRange} modules.
 *
 * {1 When to use this module}
 *
 * This module will let you manipulate dates, compute the duration between times,
 * etc.
 *
 * {1 Where should I start?}
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}

  /**
   * This function builds a date printer, that can than be used with
   * {!Date.to_formatted_string} function.
   *
   * It takes a format for printing dates as the only argument. The
   * format is largely based on the format accepted by the Unix date
   * command and the following documentation largely borrows from
   * date's man page (author: David MacKenzie).
   *
   * The interpreted sequences in the string format are the following:
   *
   * - [%%] a literal [%],
   * - [%a] abbreviated weekday name (ex. Mon, Tue, Wed, ...)
   * - [%A] full weekday name (ex. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ...)
   * - [%b] abbreviated month name (ex. Jan, Feb, Mar, ...)
   * - [%B] full month name (ex. January, February, ...)
   * - [%c] date and time; same as [%a %b %_d %Y %T] (ex, Thu Mar  3 2005 23:05:25)
   * - [%C] century, like [%Y] but with last two digits omitted (ex. 20)
   * - [%d] day of month (01-31)
   * - [%e] day of month, space padded; same as [%_d] (ex.  3; with space in front of 3)
   * - [%E] day of month with suffixes 'st', 'nd' or 'th'
   * - [%D] date; same as [%m/%d/%y] (ex. 03/07/10)
   * - [%F] full date; same as [%Y-%m-%d] (ex. 2010-03-07)
   * - [%h] same as [%b] (ex. Jan, Feb, Mar, ...)
   * - [%H] hour (00..23)
   * - [%I] hour (01..12)
   * - [%k] hour ( 0..23)
   * - [%l] hour ( 1..12)
   * - [%m] month (01..12)
   * - [%M] minute (00..59)
   * - [%n] a newline
   * - [%p] 12h period name (AM/PM)
   * - [%P] like [%p], but lower case (am/pm)
   * - [%R] 24-hour hour and minute; same as [%H:%M] (ex. 17:35)
   * - [%S] second (00..59)
   * - [%x] millisecond (000..999)
   * - [%t] a tab
   * - [%T] time; same as [%H:%M:%S] (ex. 17:35:12)
   * - [%u] day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday
   * - [%w] day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday
   * - [%y] last two digits of year (00..99)
   * - [%Y] year (ex. 2010)
   * - [%z] +hhmm numeric timezone (e.g., -0400)
   *
   * By default, numeric fields are padded with zeroes. The following optional flags
   * may follow `%':
   * - [-] (hyphen) do not pad the field
   * - [_] (underscore) pad with spaces
   * - [0] (zero) pad with zeros
   *
   * For now the following sequences used in Unix's date are unsupported:
   * - [%g] the  last  two  digits  of the year corresponding to the %V week number
   * - [%G] the year corresponding to the %V week number
   * - [%j] day of year (001..366)
   * - [%N] nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)
   * - [%s] seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC
   * - [%U] week number of year with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)
   * - [%V] week number of year with Monday as first day of week (01..53)
   * - [%W] week number of year with Monday as first day of week (00..53)
   * - [%:z] +hh:mm numeric timezone (e.g., -04:00)
   *
   * Also the padding directives are not supported:
   * - [%^] use upper case if possible
   * - [%#] use opposite case if possible
   *
   * Moreover, the following locale-sensitive sequences for now work with the fixed
   * English locale:
   *  [%a], [%A], [%b], [%B], [%c], [%p], [%P], [%r], [%x], [%X]
   *
   * @param format a format for printing dates (as described above)
   * @return either [success(printer)] where [printer] is a printer for dates
   *         using [format], or [failure(error)] where [error] is a string
