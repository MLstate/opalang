/**
 * {1 About this module}

 * Contains the [outcome] data type, which represents an outcome of
 * some action, which can be either successful (and carry the result
 * value) or it can be a failure (and carry the description of the
 * problem).
 *
 * {1 Where should I start ?}
 *
 * So the [outcome] type has two constructors:
 *   - [{success=value}], with some [value]
 *   - [{failure=problem}], with indication of the [problem].
 * and it is parametrized by the types of: [value] and [problem].
 *
 * {1 What if I need more?}
