 *   - This will look like the current Db module (as far as we can implement it).  Mostly you
 *     will get: read/write/remove/{int/string}map_search/{int/string}map_fold_range.  Note that
 *     implementing history with MongoDB could prove heavy-weight and potentially disastrous
 *     for performance although I'm sure it could be done.  A primitive form of transaction,
 *     however, might be a good option.  Modification time could be handled low-level in
 *     the driver at the expense of some peformance.
