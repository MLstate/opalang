/**
 *
 * Firstly, as an aside, note that we could very easily implement a MongoDB backend
 * for db-light using only the OCaml-based bson.ml and mongo.ml code.
 *
 * Design goals for the new high-level MongoDB code are simple, I think:
 *
 *   1) We want a generalisation of the existing Db interface, for example we don't
 *      want to be restricted to int and string maps.
 *
 *   2) We want a MongoDB interface which allows as much of the work, searches etc.
 *      to be carried out by the MongoDB server.
 *
 *   3) We want to be able to implement or emulate foreign keys efficiently.
 *
 *   4) We want to handle maps as objects without reading the entire database to
 *      construct the map.  I am assuming here that the Map interface will continue
 *      to be the "standard" way of viewing a database in OPA.
 *
 *   5) We want the Db interface to be a subset of this module, or at least emulatable
 *      using the constructs in this module.
 *
 * The following are what I would call "side-conditions" rather than subgoals:
 *
 *   a) We are prepared to tolerate a naive mapping of recursive types into nested BSON
 *      documents.  We can accept that a 10^6 element list will map to a document
 *      nested 10^6 deep which MongoDB may or may not be able to handle.
 *
 *   b) We will make an effort to map naturally onto MongoDB's types, for example, MongoDB
 *      provides many useful functions which operate over arrays so it would seem to make
 *      sense to map lists onto arrays.  Other special cases could be handled for efficiency.
 *
 *   c) Initially, the dbGen syntax can be ignored in the assumption that it can be
 *      implemented later using a dedicated syntax-based compiler phase generating calls
 *      to the MongoDb module.
 *
 * I am proposing to use the existing OPA to BSON module which currently only exists
 * in the dbMongo code but which could be factored out for use here.  An initial design
 * might be:
 *
 * Revised design <Thu Oct  6 10:02:54 CEST 2011>
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *   A map is:
 *     { label -> value; label2 -> value2; ... }
 *
 *   A set can be viewed as a degenerate map:
 *     { label -> ; label2 -> ; ... }
 *
 *   A map can be implemented within a set:
 *     { (label,value) -> ; (label2,value2) ->; ... }
 *
 *   An array can be viewed as a specialisation of a map:
 *     { 0 -> value; 1 -> value2; ... }
 *
 *   A map can be implemented within an array:
 *     { 0 -> (label,value); 1 -> (label2,value2); ... }
 *
 *   etc. etc. (set within array):
 *     { 0 -> (label,()); 1 -> (label2,()); ... }
 *
 *   The main difference between these is the computational complexity of the basic ops.
 *
 *   Now MongoDB implements heterogeneous sets (collections) of (labeled) Bson documents:
 *     { {"label":value}, {"label2":value2} }
 *   (where value, value2 can be documents) which is, in effect, a map from keys to values
 *
 *   The current "standard" OPA type to Bson implementation is simple:
 *     {a:'a; b:'b} -> { a: 'a, b: 'b }
 *     'a -> { value: 'a }
 *   where we use a "natural" mapping of constant types: int -> Int64, string -> String etc.
 *   special cases:
 *     list('a) -> { Array=(<label>,{ 0:'a; 1:'a; ... }) }
 *     Bson.document -> Bson.document (verbatim, including labels)
 *
 *   An update is:
 *     update(db,select,update)
 *   where select defines the the values to be updated and update
 *   specifies the new values.
 *
 *   A query is:
 *     query(num_to_skip,num_to_return,select,field_select)
 *   where select defines the values to return, field_select
 *   says which fields in the value to return (_id is always included).
 *
 *   The current schema for mapping dbGen syntax to MongoDB documents is:
 *
 *     file: prog.opa
 *     definitions:
 *       db /coll/x : t
 *       db /coll/y : u
 *       db /coll/...
 * 
 *     Leads to:
 * 
 *     database name: "prog_exe" (or whatever is defined in the program)
 *     collection name: "coll"
 *     OPA type: {x:t} / {y:u} / ...
 *     MongoDB: the OPA to Bson schema above.
 * 
 *  Notes:
 *
 *    - This is different from the existing dbGen syntax since
 *      multiple db definitions at the root of the path now map to sum
 *      types instead of records.  This allows storage of multiple types
 *      in the same collection.
